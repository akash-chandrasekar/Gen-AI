You’ll enjoy crisp mornings, pleasant afternoons, and evenings that are perfect for stargazing.\\n\\n2. **Natural Beauty That Changes With the Seasons**  \\n   - From the turquoise high‑altitude lakes of Ladakh to the mist‑clad tea gardens of Munnar, each location showcases a different facet of India’s geography—mountains, valleys, forests, and deserts.\\n\\n3. **Cultural Richness & Authentic Experiences**  \\n   - **Ladakh** and **Spiti** let you walk among centuries‑old Buddhist monasteries.  \\n   - **Coorg** offers a glimpse into the vibrant Kodava traditions and cuisine.  \\n   - **Darjeeling** blends colonial heritage with Tibetan Buddhist culture.  \\n   - **Munnar** preserves the legacy of tea‑plantation workers and indigenous tribes.\\n\\n4. **Adventure Opportunities**  \\n   - Trekking, mountain biking, river rafting, and high‑altitude camping are readily available. Even if you prefer a relaxed pace, scenic drives, wildlife safaris, and gentle walks are abundant.\\n\\n5. **Less Crowded Than Peak Tourist Seasons**  \\n   - Summer is the off‑peak period for most hill stations, meaning you’ll encounter shorter lines, more personal interactions with locals, and better chances to secure boutique accommodations.\\n\\n6. **Accessibility & Infrastructure**  \\n   - All five destinations are reachable by a combination of flights (e.g., Delhi → Leh, Bangalore → Coorg via Mysore, Kolkata → Bagdogra → Darjeeling) and well‑maintained roads. Tourist facilities—from comfortable homestays to luxury resorts—cater to a range of budgets.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Quick Planning Tips\\n\\n| Tip | Details |\\n|-----|---------|\\n| **Acclimatization** | For Ladakh & Spiti, spend at least 2–3 days at moderate altitude (e.g., Leh or Kaza) before heading to higher passes. |\\n| **Travel Light** | Pack layers: a warm jacket for evenings, a lightweight fleece for daytime, and breathable shirts. Sun protection (hat, sunscreen) is essential even at altitude. |\\n| **Permits** | Some areas (e.g., certain parts of Ladakh & Spiti) require Inner Line Permits for foreign nationals; Indian tourists usually need an **ID proof** and may need a **Protected Area Permit** for specific villages. |\\n| **Best Transport** | Hire a reliable local driver for mountain roads; they know the safest routes and can adapt to sudden weather changes. |\\n| **Health & Safety** | Carry a basic first‑aid kit, stay hydrated, and avoid over‑exertion at high altitude. In monsoon‑prone zones (e.g., Munnar), keep rain gear handy. |\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Sample 10‑Day Itinerary (Mix & Match)\\n\\n| Day | Morning | Afternoon | Evening |\\n|-----|---------|-----------|---------|\\n| **1‑2** | Fly to **Leh**, acclimatize, explore Leh market | Visit **Shanti Stupa**, **Leh Palace** | Sunset at **Khardung La** viewpoint |\\n| **3‑4** | Drive to **Pangong Tso**, boat ride | Head to **Nubra Valley** (Hunder Sand Dunes) | Stay in a desert camp |\\n| **5** | Fly to **Bengaluru**, transfer to **Coorg** | Coffee plantation tour | Traditional **Kodava** dinner |\\n| **6‑7** | Trek to **Abbey Falls**, **Talakaveri** (source of the Cauvery) | Visit **Madikeri Fort** & **Raja’s Seat** | Relax at a spice‑spa |\\n| **8** | Fly to **Kochi**, drive to **Munnar** | Tea garden walk, **Tea Museum** | Sunset over **Mullaperiyar Dam** |\\n| **9** | Early hike in **Eravikulam NP** (Anamudi) | Picnic at **Mattupetty Lake** | Night under the stars (optional homestay) |\\n| **10** | Return to **Kochi** for departure or extend to **Alleppey** for a house‑boat cruise |\\n\\n*(Feel free to swap destinations—e.g., replace Coorg with Darjeeling, or add Spiti after Ladakh for a longer high‑altitude adventure.)*\\n\\n---\\n\\n**Enjoy your summer adventure in India!** 🌄✨ If you need help with bookings, detailed trekking permits, or customizing the itinerary to match your interests (wildlife, photography, yoga retreats, etc.), just let me know—I’m happy to dive deeper.' additional_kwargs={'reasoning_content': 'The user wants best 5 places to visit in India in summer, and description why they should visit.

The crisp mountain air is a welcome escape from the heat of the plains. | • Rohtang & Solang Pass for snow‑capped vistas (early summer) <br>• Paragliding, river rafting on the Beas <br>• Old Manali’s cafés & Tibetan market <br>• Trek to Jogini Waterfall or the Great Himalayan National Park |\n",
      "| **2** | **Munnar, Kerala** | A tea‑plantation haven at 1,600 m, with mist‑covered hills and temperatures rarely above 28 °C. The monsoon begins late‑June, turning the landscape into a lush carpet of green. | • Tea‑garden walks & factory tours <br>• Eravikulam National Park – home of the endangered Nilgiri Tahr <br>• Anamudi Peak trek (South India’s highest) <br>• Spice‑plantation visits & Ayurvedic spa treatments |\n",
      "| **3** | **Coorg (Kodagu), Karnataka** | Known as the “Scotland of India,” Coorg sits at 1,200 m and enjoys pleasant 20‑30 °C weather. Coffee estates, waterfalls, and dense forests make it a cool, aromatic retreat. | • Coffee‑plantation homestays <br>• Abbey Falls, Iruppu Falls, and Talacauvery (the river’s source) <br>• Dubare Elephant Camp – interact with gentle giants <br>• Trek to Tadiandamol (the highest peak in Coorg) |\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Diverse Experiences in One Country**  \n",
      "   *From snow‑capped passes (Manali) to tea‑garden serenity (Munnar), from spiritual yoga retreats (Rishikesh) to high‑altitude desert beauty (Ladakh), you can sample vastly different Indian landscapes in a single vacation.*\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Adventure & Wellness Combo**  \n",
      "   - **Adventure**: trekking, rafting, paragliding, camel safaris, and mountain biking are readily available.  \n",
      "   - **Wellness**: yoga ashrams, Ayurvedic spas, and tranquil tea/coffee estates provide restorative downtime.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cultural Richness**  \n",
      "   - **Manali & Rishikesh**: Himalayan folklore, Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, and vibrant local festivals.  \n",
      "   - **Munnar & Coorg**: Indigenous tribal heritage, colonial‑era plantations, and unique culinary flavors (e.g., Coorgi pork, Kerala’s appam).  \n",
      "   - **Ladakh**: Buddhist monasteries with ancient murals, traditional Ladakhi festivals (like Hemis Festival in July), and warm hospitality of the local people.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Accessibility & Infrastructure**  \n",
      "   - **Airports**: Leh (Ladakh), Dehradun (Uttarakhand), Kochi (near Munnar), and Bhuntar (near Manali) have regular flights from major Indian metros.  \n",
      "   - **Road & Rail**: Well‑maintained highways and rail links connect these spots to Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata, making self‑drive or train travel feasible.  \n",
      "   - **Accommodation**: Options range from luxury resorts (e.g., The Oberoi in Munnar) to budget hostels, boutique homestays, and eco‑lodges—so you can tailor the trip to your style and wallet.\n",

      "| **Packing Essentials** | Light jackets or fleece (nights can be chilly), comfortable trekking shoes, sunscreen, sunglasses, reusable water bottle, and a basic first‑aid kit. |\n",
      "| **Local Transport** | Hire a reliable local driver for mountain roads (especially in Ladakh & Manali). In Kerala & Karnataka, auto‑rickshaws and shared cabs work well. |\n",
      "| **Health Precautions** | Acclimatize to altitude in Ladakh (spend a day in Leh before heading higher). Stay hydrated; carry oral rehydration salts if trekking. |\n",

These models, often based on deep learning architectures like transformers (e.g., GPT, BERT) for text or diffusion networks and GANs for images, generate outputs that resemble the data they were trained on. Common applications include chatbots, code assistants, image synthesis, music composition, and content summarization. Gen AI works by predicting the next element in a sequence (e.g., the next word in a sentence) or by iteratively refining a noisy input until it matches the learned data distribution, enabling it to produce coherent and context‑aware results.'}\n"

All references to the name have been updated in this blog.\\nAI chatbots use generative AI to provide responses based on a single interaction. A person makes a query and the chatbot uses natural language processing to reply.\\nThe next frontier of artificial intelligence is agentic AI, which uses sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning to autonomously solve complex, multi-step problems. And it’s set to enhance productivity and operations across industries.\\nAn AI agent for customer service, for instance, could operate beyond simple question-answering. With agentic AI, it could check a user’s outstanding balance and recommend which accounts could pay it off — all while waiting for the user to make a decision so it could complete the transaction accordingly when prompted.\\nAgentic AI systems ingest vast amounts of data from multiple data sources and third-party applications to independently analyze challenges, develop strategies and execute tasks. Businesses are implementing agentic AI to personalize customer service, streamline software development and even facilitate patient interactions.\\n\\nAgentic AI uses sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning to solve complex, multi-step problems.\\nHow Does Agentic AI Work?\\nAgentic AI uses a four-step process for problem-solving:\\n\\nPerceive: AI agents gather and process data from various sources, such as sensors, databases and digital interfaces. This involves extracting meaningful features, recognizing objects or identifying relevant entities in the environment.\\nReason: A large language model acts as the orchestrator, or reasoning engine, that understands tasks, generates solutions and coordinates specialized models for specific functions like content creation, visual processing or recommendation systems. This step uses techniques like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to access proprietary data sources and deliver accurate, relevant outputs.\\nAct: By integrating with external tools and software via application programming interfaces, agentic AI can quickly execute tasks based on the plans it has formulated. Guardrails can be built into AI agents to help ensure they execute tasks correctly. For example, a customer service AI agent may be able to process claims up to a certain amount, while claims above the amount would have to be approved by a human.\\nLearn: Agentic AI continuously improves through a feedback loop, or\\n“data flywheel,” where the data generated from its interactions is fed into the system to enhance models. This ability to adapt and become more effective over time offers businesses a powerful tool for driving better decision-making and operational efficiency.\\n\\nFueling Agentic AI With Enterprise Data\\nAcross industries and job functions, generative AI is transforming organizations by turning vast amounts of data into actionable knowledge, helping employees work more efficiently.\\nAI agents build on this potential by accessing diverse data through accelerated AI query engines, which process, store and retrieve information to enhance generative AI models. A key technique for achieving this is RAG, which allows AI to intelligently retrieve the right information from a broader range of data sources.\\nOver time, AI agents learn and improve by creating a data flywheel, where data generated through interactions is fed back into the system, refining models and increasing their effectiveness.\\nThe end-to-end NVIDIA AI platform, including NVIDIA NeMo microservices for developing custom generative AI applications, provides the ability to manage and access data efficiently, which is crucial for building responsive agentic AI applications.\\nAgentic AI in Action\\nThe potential applications of agentic AI are vast, limited only by creativity and expertise. From simple tasks like generating and distributing content to more complex use cases such as orchestrating enterprise software, AI agents are transforming industries.\\n\\nCustomer Service: AI agents are improving customer support by enhancing self-service capabilities and automating routine communications. Over half of service professionals report significant improvements in customer interactions, reducing response times and boosting satisfaction.\\nThere’s also growing interest in digital humans — AI-powered agents that embody a company’s brand and offer lifelike, real-time interactions to help sales representatives answer customer queries or solve issues directly when call volumes are high.\\nContent Creation: Agentic AI can help quickly create high-quality, personalized marketing content. Generative AI agents can save marketers an average of three hours per content piece, allowing them to focus on strategy and innovation. By streamlining content creation, businesses can stay competitive while improving customer engagement.\\nSoftware Engineering: AI agents are boosting developer productivity by automating repetitive coding tasks. It’s projected that by 2030 AI could automate up to 30% of work hours, freeing developers to focus on more complex challenges and drive innovation.\\nHealthcare: For doctors analyzing vast amounts of medical and patient data, AI agents can distill critical information to help them make better-informed care decisions. Automating administrative tasks and capturing clinical notes in patient appointments reduces the burden of time-consuming tasks, allowing doctors to focus on developing a doctor-patient connection.\\nAI agents can also provide 24/7 support, offering information on prescribed medication usage, appointment scheduling and reminders, and more to help patients adhere to treatment plans.\\nVideo analytics: Enterprises and public sector organizations around the world are developing video analytics AI agents to boost the capabilities of workforces that rely on visual information from a growing number of devices — including cameras, IoT sensors and vehicles. Video analytics AI agents can analyze large amounts of live or archived videos, request tasks via natural language and perform complex operations like video search, summarization and visual question-answering. These agents can also be used to deliver anomaly alerts, draft incident reports, improve quality control through visual inspection and enhance predictive maintenance.\\nHow to Get Started\\nWith its ability to plan and interact with a wide variety of tools and software, agentic AI marks the next chapter of artificial intelligence, offering the potential to enhance productivity and revolutionize the way organizations operate.\\nTo accelerate the adoption of generative AI-powered applications and agents, NVIDIA Blueprints provide sample applications, reference code, sample data, tools and comprehensive documentation.\\nNVIDIA partners including Accenture are helping enterprises use agentic AI with solutions built with NVIDIA Blueprints.\\nVisit ai.nvidia.com to learn more about the tools and software NVIDIA offers to help enterprises build their own AI agents.\\xa0\\n\\n\\nCategories: Explainer | Generative AITags: Agentic AI | Artificial Intelligence | NVIDIA Blueprints \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll NVIDIA News \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCheers to AI: ADAM Robot Bartender Makes Drinks at Vegas Golden Knights Game\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs AI Grows More Complex, Model Builders Rely on NVIDIA\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRide Into Adventure With Capcom’s ‘Monster Hunter Stories’ Series in the Cloud\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOpt-In NVIDIA Software Enables Data Center Fleet Management\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHow NVIDIA H100 GPUs on CoreWeave’s AI Cloud Platform Delivered a Record-Breaking Graph500 Run\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCorporate Information\\nAbout NVIDIA\\nCorporate Overview\\nTechnologies\\nNVIDIA Research\\nInvestors\\nSocial Responsibility\\nNVIDIA Foundation\\n \\n\\nGet Involved\\nForums\\nCareers\\nDeveloper Home\\nJoin the Developer Program\\nNVIDIA Partner Network\\nNVIDIA Inception\\nResources for Venture Capitalists\\nVenture Capital (NVentures)\\nTechnical Training\\nTraining for IT Professionals\\nProfessional Services for Data Science\\n \\n\\nNews & Events\\nNewsroom\\nNVIDIA Blog\\nNVIDIA Technical Blog\\nWebinars\\nStay Informed\\nEvents Calendar\\nNVIDIA GTC\\nNVIDIA On-Demand\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tExplore our regional blogs and other social networks\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\nYour Privacy Choices\\nTerms of Service\\nAccessibility\\nCorporate Policies\\nProduct Security\\nContact\\n \\n\\t\\t\\tCopyright © 2025 NVIDIA Corporation\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUSA - United States\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\xa0Share This\\xa0Facebook\\xa0LinkedIn \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare on Mastodon\\n\\n\\nEnter your Mastodon instance URL (optional)\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare this Article\\n\\nFriend's Email Address\\n\\n\\n\\nYour Name\\n\\n\\n\\nYour Email Address\\n\\n\\n\\nComments\\n\\n\\n\\n Send Email\\n\\n\\nEmail sent!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\")]"

       " 'answer': '**Agentic AI** (as described in NVIDIA’s blog post) is a form of artificial intelligence that can **autonomously tackle complex, multi‑step problems** by employing sophisticated reasoning and iterative planning.  \\n\\nKey characteristics:\\n\\n| Feature | Description |\\n|---------|-------------|\\n| **Autonomous problem‑solving** | The system independently ingests large volumes of data from many sources, analyzes the challenge, devises a strategy, and carries out the necessary tasks without continual human direction. |\\n| **Iterative planning** | It repeatedly refines its plan as it progresses, allowing it to handle dynamic or uncertain environments. |\\n| **Multi‑step reasoning** | Unlike single‑prompt models that produce a one‑off answer, agentic AI can break a problem into a sequence of logical steps, evaluate intermediate results, and adjust its approach. |\\n| **Broad applicability** | It can be used for simple automation (e.g., content generation and distribution) as well as more complex orchestration such as enterprise software management, personalized customer service, software development pipelines, and patient‑interaction workflows. |\\n\\nIn short, **Agentic AI is an AI paradigm that combines large‑scale data ingestion, advanced reasoning, and self‑directed, iterative planning to solve intricate tasks end‑to‑end without constant human supervision.**'}"

The work and primary storage of \\nthe data is in relational databases. All of the data processing is done with SQL or a \\nSQL-based language. Sometimes, this data processing is done with an ETL tool.2 The \\nsecond type of data engineering is Big Data –focused. The work and primary storage \\nof the data is in Big Data technologies like Hadoop, Cassandra, and HBase.

This section is not a history lesson, but looking at the past is invaluable \\nin understanding where we are today and where things are going. A common theme \\nconstantly reappears: what’s old is new again. \\nThe early days: 1980 to 2000, from data warehousing to the web \\nThe birth of the data engineer arguably has its roots in data warehousing, dating as far \\nback as the 1970s, with the business data warehouse taking shape in the 1980s and Bill \\nInmon officially coining the term data warehouse in 1989. After engineers at IBM \\ndeveloped the relational database and Structured Query Language (SQL), Oracle \\npopularized the technology. As nascent data systems grew, businesses needed \\ndedicated tools and data pipelines for reporting and business intelligence (BI). To help \\npeople correctly model their business logic in the data warehouse, Ralph Kimball and \\nInmon developed their respective eponymous data -modeling techniques and \\napproaches, which are still widely used today. \\nData warehousing ushered in the first age of scalable analytics, with new massively \\nparallel processing (MPP) databases that use multiple processors to crunch large \\namounts of data coming on the market and supporting unprecedented volumes of data. \\nRoles such as BI engineer, ETL developer, and data warehouse engineer addressed the \\nvarious needs of the data warehouse. Data warehouse and BI engineering were a \\nprecursor to today’s data engineering and still play a central role in the discipline. \\nThe internet went mainstream around the mid-1990s, creating a whole new generation \\nof web -first companies such as AOL, Yahoo, and Amazon. The dot -com boom \\nspawned a ton of activity in web applications and the backend systems to support \\nthem—servers, databa ses, and storage. Much of the infrastructure was expensive, \\nmonolithic, and heavily licensed. The vendors selling these backend systems likely \\ndidn’t foresee the sheer scale of the data that web applications would produce. \\nThe early 2000s: The birth of contemporary data engineering \\nFast-forward to the early 2000s, when the dot -com boom of the late ’90s went bust, \\nleaving behind a tiny cluster of survivors. Some of these companies, such as Yahoo, \\nGoogle, and Amazon, would grow into powerhouse tech companies. Initially, these \\ncompanies continued to rely on the traditional monolithic, relational databases and data \\nwarehouses of the 1990s, pushing these systems to the limit. As these systems buckled,'),\n",

The new generation of the \\nsystems must be cost-effective, scalable, available, and reliable. \\nCoinciding with the explosion of data, commodity hardware—such as servers, RAM, \\ndisks, and flash drives —also became cheap and ubiquitous. Several innovations \\nallowed distributed computation and storage on massive computing clusters at a vast \\nscale. These i nnovations started decentralizing and breaking apart traditionally \\nmonolithic services. The “big data” era had begun. \\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines big data as “extremely large data sets that may \\nbe analyzed computationally to reveal patterns, trends, and associations, especially \\nrelating to human behavior and interactions.” Another famous and succinct description \\nof big data is the three Vs of data: velocity, variety, and volume. \\nIn 2003, Google published a paper on the Google File System, and shortly after that, \\nin 2004, a paper on MapReduce, an ultra-scalable data-processing paradigm. In truth, \\nbig data has earlier antecedents in MPP data warehouses and data management for \\nexperimental physics projects, but Google’s publications constituted a “big bang” for \\ndata technologies and the cultural roots of data engineering as we know it today. You’ll \\nlearn more about MPP systems and MapReduce in Chapters 3 and 8, respectively. \\nThe Google papers inspired engineers at Yahoo to develop and later open source \\nApache Hadoop in 2006. 6  It’s hard to overstate the impact of Hadoop. Software \\nengineers interested in large-scale data problems were drawn to the possibilities of this \\nnew open source technology ecosystem. As companies of all sizes and types saw their \\ndata grow into many terabytes and even petabytes, the era of the big data engineer was \\nborn. \\nAround the same time, Amazon had to keep up with its own exploding data needs and \\ncreated elastic computing environments (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, or EC2), \\ninfinitely scalable storage systems (Amazon Simple Storage Service, or S3), highly \\nscalable NoSQL databases (Amazon DynamoDB), and many other core data building \\nblocks.7 Amazon elected to offer these services for internal and external consumption \\nthrough Amazon Web Services (AWS), becoming the first popular public cloud. AWS \\ncreated an ultra -flexible pay -as-you-go resource marketplace by virtualizing and \\nreselling vast pools of commodity hardware. Instead of purchasing hardware for a data \\ncenter, developers could simply rent compute and storage from \\nAWS. \\n \\n6 Cade Metz, “How Yahoo Spawned Hadoop, the Future of Big Data,” Wired, October 18, 2011, \\nhttps://oreil.ly/iaD9G. \\n7 Ron Miller, “How AWS Came to Be,” TechCrunch, July 2, 2016, https://oreil.ly/VJehv.'),\n",

Another \\nrevolution occurred with the transition from batch computing to event streaming, \\nushering in a new era of big “real -time” data.

Traditional \\nenterpriseoriented and GUI -based data tools suddenly felt outmoded, and code -first \\nengineering was in vogue with the ascendance of MapReduce. We (the authors) were \\naround during this time, and it felt like old dogmas died a sudden death upon the altar \\nof big data. \\nThe explosion of data tools in the late 2000s and 2010s ushered in the big data \\nengineer. To effectively use these tools and techniques —namely, the Hadoop \\necosystem including Hadoop, Y ARN, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and \\nMapReduce—big data engineers had to be proficient in software development and \\nlow-level infrastructure hacking, but with a shifted emphasis. Big data engineers \\ntypically maintained massive clusters of commodity hardware to deliver data at scale. \\nWhile they might occasionally submit pull requests to Hadoop core code, they shifted \\ntheir focus from core technology development to data delivery. \\nBig data quickly became a victim of its own success. As a buzzword, big data gained \\npopularity during the early 2000s through the mid -2010s. Big data captured the \\nimagination of companies trying to make sense of the ever -growing volumes of data \\nand the endless barrage of shameless marketing from companies selling big data tools \\nand services. Because of the immense hype, it was common to see companies using \\nbig data tools for small data problems, sometimes standing up a Hadoop cluster to \\nprocess just a few gigabytes.

So, we’ll create our own simplified data maturity model. Our data \\nmaturity model (Figure 1-8) has three stages: starting with data, scaling with data, and \\nleading with data. Let’s look at each of these stages and at what a data engineer \\ntypically does at each stage. \\n \\nFigure 1-8. Our simplified data maturity model for a company \\nStage 1: Starting with data \\nA company getting started with data is, by definition, in the very early stages of its data \\nmaturity. The company may have fuzzy, loosely defined goals or no goals. Data \\narchitecture and infrastructure are in the very early stages of planning and \\ndevelopment. Adoption and utilization are likely low or nonexistent. The data team is \\nsmall, often with a headcount in the single digits. At this stage, a data engineer is \\nusually a generalist and will typically play several other roles, such as data scientist or \\nsoftware engineer. A data engineer’s goal is to move fast, get traction, and add value. \\nThe practicalities of getting value from data are typically poorly understood, but the \\ndesire exists. Reports or analyses lack formal structure, and most requests for data are \\nad hoc. While it’s tempting to jump headfirst into ML at this stage, we don’t \\nrecommend it. We’ve seen countless data teams get stuck and fall short when they try \\nto jump to ML without building a solid data foundation. \\nThat’s not to say you can’t get wins from ML at this stage —it is rare but possible. \\nWithout a solid data foundation, you likely won’t have the data to train reliable ML \\nmodels nor the means to deploy these models to production in a scalable and repeatable \\nway.

This means determining business goals and the competitive advantage \\nyou’re aiming to achieve with your data initiative. Work toward a data architecture \\nthat supports these goals. See Chapter 3 for our advice on “good” data architecture. \\n• Identify and audit data that will support key initiatives and operate within the data \\narchitecture you designed. \\n• Build a solid data foundation for future data analysts and data scientists to generate \\nreports and models that provide competitive value.

Getting quick wins will establish the importance of data within the \\norganization. Just keep in mind that quick wins will likely create technical debt. \\nHave a plan to reduce this debt, as it will otherwise add friction for future delivery. \\n• Get out and talk to people, and avoid working in silos. We often see the data team \\nworking in a bubble, not communicating with people outside their departments \\nand getting perspectives and feedback from business stakeholders. The danger is \\nyou’ll spend a lot of time working on things of little use to people. \\n• Avoid undifferentiated heavy lifting. Don’t box yourself in with unnecessary \\ntechnical complexity. Use off-the-shelf, turnkey solutions wherever possible. \\n• Build custom solutions and code only where this creates a competitive advantage. \\nStage 2: Scaling with data \\nAt this point, a company has moved away from ad hoc data requests and has formal \\ndata practices. Now the challenge is creating scalable data architectures and planning \\nfor a future where the company is genuinely data-driven.

Data engineers remain software \\nengineers, in addition to their many other roles. \\nWhat languages should a data engineer know? We divide data engineering \\nprogramming languages into primary and secondary categories. At the time of this \\nwriting, the primary languages of data engineering are SQL, Python, a Java Virtual \\nMachine (JVM) language (usually Java or Scala), and bash: \\nSQL \\nThe most common interface for databases and data lakes. After briefly being \\nsidelined by the need to write custom MapReduce code for big data processing, \\nSQL (in various forms) has reemerged as the lingua franca of data. \\nPython \\nThe bridge language between data engineering and data science. A growing \\nnumber of data engineering tools are written in Python or have Python APIs. It’s \\nknown as “the second-best language at everything.” Python underlies popular data \\ntools such as pandas,  NumPy, Airflow, sci-kit learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and \\nPySpark. Python is the glue between underlying components and is frequently a \\nfirst-class API language for interfacing with a framework. \\nJVM languages such as Java and Scala \\nPrevalent for Apache open source projects such as Spark, Hive, and Druid. The \\nJVM is generally more performant than Python and may provide access to lower-\\nlevel features than a Python API (for example, this is the case for Apache Spark \\nand Beam). Understan ding Java or Scala will be beneficial if you’re using a \\npopular open source data framework. \\nbash \\nThe command -line interface for Linux operating systems. Knowing bash \\ncommands and being comfortable using CLIs will significantly improve your \\nproductivity and workflow when you need to script or perform OS operations. \\nEven today, data engineers frequently use command-line tools like awk or sed to \\nprocess files in a data pipeline or call bash commands from orchestration \\nframeworks. If you’re using Windows, feel free to substitute PowerShell for bash. \\nThe Unreasonable Effectiveness of SQL \\nThe advent of MapReduce and the big data era relegated SQL to passé status. Since then, \\nvarious developments have dramatically enhanced the utility of SQL in the data \\nengineering lifecycle. Spark SQL, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, Hive, and many other \\ndata tools can process massive amounts of data by using declarative, set -theoretic SQL \\nsemantics.

We believe that competent data engineers should be highly proficient \\nin SQL. \\nAre we saying that SQL is a be-all and end-all language? Not at all. SQL is a powerful \\ntool that can quickly solve complex analytics and data transformation problems. Given \\nthat time is a primary constraint for data engineering team throughput, engineers \\nshould embrace tools that combine simplicity and high productivity. Data engineers \\nalso do well to develop expertise in composing SQL with other operations, either \\nwithin frameworks such as Spark and Flink or by using orchestration to combine \\nmultiple tools . Data engineers should also learn modern SQL semantics for dealing \\nwith JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) parsing and nested data and consider \\nleveraging a SQL management framework such as dbt (Data Build Tool). \\nA proficient data engineer also recognizes when SQL is not the right tool for the job \\nand can choose and code in a suitable alternative. A SQL expert could likely write a \\nquery to stem and tokenize raw text in a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline \\nbut would also recognize that coding in native Spark is a far superior alternative to this \\nmasochistic exercise. \\nData engineers may also need to develop proficiency in secondary programming \\nlanguages, including R, JavaScript, Go, Rust, C/C++, C#, and Julia. Developing in \\nthese languages is often necessary when popular across the company or used with \\ndomain-specific data tools.

In this case, the data engineer avoids undifferentiated \\nheavy lifting, keeping data architecture as abstract and straightforward as possible \\nand not reinventing the wheel. Type A data engineers manage the data engineering \\nlifecycle mainly by using entire ly off-the-shelf products, managed services, and \\ntools. Type A data engineers work at companies across industries and at all levels \\nof data maturity. \\nType B data engineers \\nB stands for build. Type B data engineers build data tools and systems that scale \\nand leverage a company’s core competency and competitive advantage. In the data \\nmaturity range, a type B data engineer is more commonly found at companies in \\nstage 2 and 3 (scaling and leading with data), or when an initial data use case is so \\nunique and mission-critical that custom data tools are required to get started. \\nType A and type B data engineers may work in the same company and may even be the \\nsame person! More commonly, a type A data engineer is first hired to set the foundation, \\nwith type B data engineer skill sets either learned or hired as the need arises withi n a \\ncompany. \\nData Engineers Inside an Organization \\nData engineers don’t work in a vacuum.

Data architects function at a level of abstraction one step removed \\nfrom data engineers. Data architects design the blueprint for organizational data \\nmanagement, mapping out processes and overall data architecture and systems.11They \\nalso serve as a bridge between an organization’s technical and nontechnical sides. \\nSuccessful data architects generally have “battle scars” from extensive engineering \\nexperience, allowing them to guide and assist engineers while successfully \\ncommunicating engineering challenges to nontechnical business stakeholders. Data \\narchitects implement policies for managing data across silos and business units, steer \\nglobal strategies such as data management and data governance, and guide significant \\ninitiatives. Data architects often play a central role in cloud migrations and greenfield \\ncloud design. \\nThe advent of the cloud has shifted the boundary between data architecture and data \\nengineering. Cloud data architectures are much more fluid than on -premises systems, \\nso architecture decisions that traditionally involved extensive study, long lead times, \\npurchase contracts, and hardware installation are now often made during the \\nimplementation process, just one step in a larger strategy. Nevertheless, data architects \\nwill remain influential visionaries in enterprises, working hand in hand with data \\nengineers to determine the big picture of architecture practices and data strategies. \\nDepending on the company’s data maturity and size, a data engineer may overlap with \\nor assume the responsibilities of a data architect. Therefore, a data engineer should have \\na good understanding of architecture best practices and approaches. \\nNote that we have placed data architects in the upstream stakeholders section. Data \\narchitects often help design application data layers that are source systems for data \\nengineers. Architects may also interact with data engineers at various other stages of \\nthe data engineering lifecycle. We cover “good” data architecture in Chapter 3. \\nSoftware engineers.    Software engineers build the software and systems that run a \\nbusiness; they are largely responsible for generating the internal data  that data \\nengineers will consume and process. The systems built by software engineers typically \\ngenerate application event data and logs, which are significant assets in their own right. \\nThis internal data contrasts with external data pulled from SaaS platforms or partner \\nbusinesses.

For example, this might mean setting upstream \\nexpectations on what the data software engineers need to do their jobs.

Data scientists build forward-looking models to make predictions \\nand recommendations. These models are then evaluated on live data to provide value \\nin various ways. For example, model scoring might determine automated actions in \\nresponse to real -time condi tions, recommend products to customers based on the \\nbrowsing history in their current session, or make live economic predictions used by \\ntraders. \\nAccording to common industry folklore, data scientists spend 70% to 80% of their time \\ncollecting, cleaning, and preparing data. 12  In our experience, these numbers often \\nreflect immature data science and data engineering practices. In particular, many \\npopular data science frameworks can become bottlenecks if they are not scaled up \\nappropriately.

If \\ndata engineers do their job and collaborate successfully, data scientists shouldn’t spend \\ntheir time collecting, cleaning, and preparing data after initial exploratory wo rk. Data \\nengineers should automate this work as much as possible. \\nThe need for production-ready data science is a significant driver behind the emergence \\nof the data engineering profession. Data engineers should help data scientists to enable \\na path to production. In fact, we (the authors) moved from data science to data  \\nengineering after recognizing this fundamental need. Data engineers work to provide \\nthe data automation and scale that make data science more efficient. \\nData analysts.    Data analysts (or business analysts) seek to understand business \\nperformance and trends. Whereas data scientists are forward -looking, a data analyst \\ntypically focuses on the past or present. Data analysts usually run SQL queries in a data \\nwarehouse or a da ta lake. They may also utilize spreadsheets for computation and \\nanalysis and various BI tools such as Microsoft Power BI, Looker, or Tableau. Data \\nanalysts are domain experts in the data they work with frequently and become \\nintimately familiar with data definitions, characteristics, and quality problems. A data \\nanalyst’s typical downstream customers are business users, management, and \\nexecutives. \\nData engineers work with data analysts to build pipelines for new data sources required \\nby the business. Data analysts’ subject-matter expertise is invaluable in improving data \\nquality, and they frequently collaborate with data engineers in this capacity. \\nMachine learning engineers and AI researchers.    Machine learning engineers \\n(ML engineers) overlap with data engineers and data scientists. ML engineers develop \\nadvanced ML techniques, train models, and design and maintain the infrastructure \\nrunning ML processes in a scaled production environment. ML eng ineers often have \\nadvanced working knowledge of ML and deep learning techniques and frameworks \\nsuch as PyTorch or TensorFlow. \\nML engineers also understand the hardware, services, and systems required to run these \\nframeworks, both for model training and model deployment at a production scale. It’s \\ncommon for ML flows to run in a cloud environment where ML engineers can spin up \\nand scale infrastructure resources on demand or rely on managed services. \\nAs we’ve mentioned, the boundaries between ML engineering, data engineering, and \\ndata science are blurry.

Whereas several years ago, the attention \\nof ML was focused on how to build models, ML engineering now increasingly \\nemphasizes incorporating best practices of machine learning operations (MLOps) and \\nother mature practices previously adopted in software engineering and DevOps. AI \\nresearchers work on new, advanced ML techniques. AI researchers may work inside \\nlarge technology companies, specia lized intellectual property startups (OpenAI, \\nDeepMind), or academic institutions. Some practitioners are dedicated to part -time \\nresearch in conjunction with ML engineering responsibilities inside a company. Those \\nworking inside specialized ML labs are oft en 100% dedicated to research. Research \\nproblems may target immediate practical applications or more abstract demonstrations \\nof AI. DALL -E, Gato AI, AlphaGo, and GPT -3/GPT-4 are great examples of ML \\nresearch projects. Given the pace of advancements in ML, these examples will very \\nlikely be quaint in a few years’ time.

Data engineers and their managers maintain a map of what data is available to the \\norganization—both internally and from third parties —in what time frame. They are \\nalso tasked to study primary data architectural changes in collaboration with other \\nengineering roles. For example, data engineers are often heavily involved in cloud \\nmigrations, migrations to new data systems, or deployment of streaming technologies. \\nChief information officer.    A chief information officer (CIO) is the senior C -suite \\nexecutive responsible for information technology within an organization; it is an \\ninternal-facing role. A CIO must possess deep knowledge of information technology \\nand business processes —either alone is insufficient. CIOs direct the information \\ntechnology organization, setting ongoing policies while also defining and executing \\nsignificant initiatives under the direction of the CEO. \\nCIOs often collaborate with data engineering leadership in organizations with a \\nwelldeveloped data culture. If an organization is not very high in its data maturity, a \\nCIO will typically help shape its data culture. CIOs will work with engineers and \\narchitects to map out major initiatives and make strategic decisions on adopting major \\narchitectural elements, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer \\nrelationship management (CRM) systems, cloud migrations, data systems, and \\ninternal-facing IT. \\nChief technology officer.    A chief technology officer (CTO) is similar to a CIO but \\nfaces outward. A CTO owns the key technological strategy and architectures for \\nexternalfacing applications, such as mobile, web apps, and IoT —all critical data \\nsources for data engineers. The CTO is likely a skilled technologist and has a good \\nsense of software engineering fundamentals and system architecture. In some \\norganizations without a CIO, the CTO or sometimes the chief operating officer (COO) \\nplays the role of CIO. Data engineers often report directly or indirectly through a CTO. \\nChief data officer.    The chief data officer (CDO) was created in 2002 at Capital One \\nto recognize the growing importance of data as a business asset. The CDO is \\nresponsible for a company’s data assets and strategy. CDOs are focused on data’s \\nbusiness utility but should have a strong technical grounding. CDOs oversee data \\nproducts, strategy, initiatives, and core functions such as master data management and \\nprivacy. Occasionally, CDOs manage business analytics and data engineering. \\nChief analytics officer.    The chief analytics officer (CAO) is a variant of the CDO \\nrole. Where both roles exist, the CDO focuses on the technology and organization \\nrequired to deliver data. The CAO is responsible for analytics, strategy, and decision \\nmaking for the business. A CAO may oversee data science and ML, though this largely \\ndepends on whether the company has a CDO or CTO role.'),\n",

Other data engineers are \\nstarting greenfield projects, assembling new data architectures from scratch by \\nselecting from an astonishing number of best-of-breed architecture and tooling options. \\nThese large initiatives often benefit from project management (in contrast to product \\nmanagement, discussed next). Whereas data engineers function in an infrastructure and \\nservice delivery capacity, project managers direct traffic and serve as gatekeepers. Most \\nproject managers operate according to some variation of  Agile and Scrum, with \\nWaterfall still appearing occasionally. Business never sleeps, and business stakeholders \\noften have a significant backlog of things they want to address and new initiatives they \\nwant to launch. Project managers must filter a long list of requests and prioritize critical \\ndeliverables to keep projects on track and better serve the company. \\nData engineers interact with project managers, often planning sprints for projects and \\nensuing standups related to the sprint. Feedback goes both ways, with data engineers \\ninforming project managers and other stakeholders about progress and blockers, and \\nproject managers balancing the cadence of technology teams against the ever-changing \\nneeds of the business. \\nData engineers and product managers \\nProduct managers oversee product development, often owning product lines. In the \\ncontext of data engineers, these products are called data products. Data products are \\neither built from the ground up or are incremental improvements upon existing \\nproducts.

Data is nearly always produced \\nand updated continually at its source. Batch ingestion  is simply a specialized and \\nconvenient way of processing this stream in large chunks —for example, handling a \\nfull day’s worth of data in a single batch. \\nStreaming ingestion allows us to provide data to downstream systems—whether other \\napplications, databases, or analytics systems—in a continuous, real-time fashion. Here, \\nreal-time (or near real-time) means that the data is available to a downstream system \\na short time after it is produced (e.g., less than one second later). The latency required \\nto qualify as real-time varies by domain and requirements. \\nBatch data is ingested either on a predetermined time interval or as data reaches a preset \\nsize threshold. Batch ingestion is a one-way door: once data is broken into batches, the \\nlatency for downstream consumers is inherently constrained. Because of limitations of \\nlegacy systems, batch was for a long time the default way to ingest data. Batch \\nprocessing remains an extremely popular way to ingest data for downstream \\nconsumption, particularly in analytics and ML. \\nHowever, the separation of storage and compute in many systems and the ubiquity of \\nevent-streaming and processing platforms make the continuous processing of data \\nstreams much more accessible and increasingly popular.

If I get data in real time, what actions can I take on \\nthat data that would be an improvement upon batch? \\n• Will my streaming-first approach cost more in terms of time, money, maintenance, \\ndowntime, and opportunity cost than simply doing batch? \\n• Are my streaming pipeline and system reliable and redundant if infrastructure \\nfails?'),\n",

Many great ingestion \\nframeworks do handle both batch and micro-batch ingestion styles. We think batch is \\nan excellent approach for many common use cases, such as model training and weekly \\nreporting. Adopt true real-time streaming only after identifying a business use case that \\njustifies the trade-offs against using batch. \\nPush versus pull \\nIn the push model of data ingestion, a source system writes data out to a target, whether \\na database, object store, or filesystem. In the pull model, data is retrieved from the \\nsource system. The line between the push and pull paradigms can be quite blurry; data \\nis often pushed and pulled as it works its way through the various stages of a data \\npipeline. \\nConsider, for example, the extract, transform, load (ETL) process, commonly used in \\nbatch-oriented ingestion workflows. ETL’s extract (E) part clarifies that we’re dealing \\nwith a pull ingestion model. In traditional ETL, the ingestion system queries a current \\nsource table snapshot on a fixed schedule. You’ll learn more about ETL and extract, \\nload, transform (ELT) throughout this book. \\nIn another example, consider continuous CDC, which is achieved in a few ways. One \\ncommon method triggers a message every time a row is changed in the source database. \\nThis message is pushed to a queue, where the ingestion system picks it up. Another \\ncommon CDC method uses binary logs, which record every commit to the database. \\nThe database pushes to its logs. The ingestion system reads the logs but doesn’t directly \\ninteract with the database otherwise. This adds little to no additional load to the source \\ndatabase. Some versions of batch CDC use the pull pattern. For example, in timestamp-\\nbased CDC, an ingestion system queries the source database and pulls the rows that \\nhave changed since the previous update. \\nWith streaming ingestion, data bypasses a backend database and is pushed directly to \\nan endpoint, typically with data buffered by an event-streaming platform.

Next, let’s \\nturn to the transformation stage of the data engineering lifecycle. \\nTransformation \\nAfter you’ve ingested and stored data, you need to do something with it. The next stage \\nof the data engineering lifecycle is transformation, meaning data needs to be changed \\nfrom its original form into something useful for downstream use cases. Without proper \\ntransformations, data will sit inert, and not be in a useful form for reports, analysis, or \\nML. Typically, the transformation stage is where data begins to create value for \\ndownstream user consumption. \\nImmediately after ingestion, basic transformations map data into correct types \\n(changing ingested string data into numeric and date types, for example), putting \\nrecords into standard formats, and removing bad ones. Later stages of transformation \\nmay transform the data schema and apply normalization. Downstream, we can apply \\nlarge-scale aggregation for reporting or featurize data for ML processes. \\nKey considerations for the transformation phase \\nWhen considering data transformations within the data engineering lifecycle, it helps \\nto consider the following: \\n• What’s the cost and return on investment (ROI) of the transformation? What is the \\nassociated business value? \\n• Is the transformation as simple and self-isolated as possible? \\n• What business rules do the transformations support? \\nYou can transform data in batch or while streaming in flight. As mentioned in \\n“Ingestion” on page 39, virtually all data starts life as a continuous stream; batch is just \\na specialized way of processing a data stream. Batch transformations are \\noverwhelmingly popular, but given the growing popularity of stream -processing \\nsolutions and the general increase  in the amount of streaming data, we expect the \\npopularity of streaming transformations to continue growing, perhaps entirely \\nreplacing batch processing in certain domains soon. \\nLogically, we treat transformation as a standalone area of the data engineering \\nlifecycle, but the realities of the lifecycle can be much more complicated in practice.'),\n",

Or a record within a streaming pipeline may be “enriched” with additional \\nfields and calculations before it’s sent to a data warehouse. Transformations are \\nubiquitous in various parts of the lifecycle. Data preparation, data wrangling, and \\ncleaning—these transformative tasks add value for end consumers of data. \\nBusiness logic is a major driver of data transformation, often in data modeling. Data \\ntranslates business logic into reusable elements (e.g., a sale means “somebody bought \\n12 picture frames from me for $30 each, or $360 in total”). In this case, somebody \\nbought 12 picture frames for $30 each. Data modeling is critical for obtaining a clear \\nand current picture of business processes.

The \\ncompany is confused about its performance, making business planning impossible. \\nData governance is a foundation for data -driven business practices and a \\nmissioncritical part of the data engineering lifecycle. When data governance is \\npracticed well, people, processes, and technologies align to treat data as a key business \\ndriver; if data issues occur, they are promptly handled. \\nThe core categories of data governance are discoverability, security, and \\naccountability.14 Within these core categories are subcategories, such as data quality, \\nmetadata, and privacy.

In a data-driven company, data must be available and discoverable. \\nEnd users should have quick and reliable access to the data they need to do their jobs. \\nThey should know where the data comes from, how it relates to other data, and what \\nthe data means. \\nSome key areas of data discoverability include metadata management and master data \\nmanagement. Let’s briefly describe these areas. \\nMetadata.    Metadata is “data about data,” and it underpins every section of the data \\nengineering lifecycle. Metadata is exactly the data needed to make data discoverable \\nand governable. \\nWe divide metadata into two major categories: autogenerated and human generated. \\nModern data engineering revolves around automation, but metadata collection is often \\nmanual and error prone. \\nTechnology can assist with this process, removing much of the error -prone work of \\nmanual metadata collection. We’re seeing a proliferation of data catalogs, data-lineage \\ntracking systems, and metadata management tools. Tools can crawl databases to look \\nfor relationships and monitor data pipelines to track where data comes from and where \\nit goes. A low -fidelity manual approach uses an internally led effort where various \\nstakeholders crowdsource metadata collection within the organization.

Documentation and internal wiki tools provide a key foundation for metadata \\nmanagement, but these tools should also integrate with automated data cataloging. For \\nexample, data -scanning tools can generate wiki pages with links to relevant data \\nobjects. \\nOnce metadata systems and processes exist, data engineers can consume metadata in \\nuseful ways.

A data engineer uses technical metadata to create, \\nconnect, and monitor various systems across the data engineering lifecycle. \\nHere are some common types of technical metadata that a data engineer will use: \\n• Pipeline metadata (often produced in orchestration systems) \\n• Data lineage \\n• Schema \\nOrchestration is a central hub that coordinates workflow across various systems. \\nPipeline metadata captured in orchestration systems provides details of the workflow \\nschedule, system and data dependencies, configurations, connection details, and much \\nmore. \\nData-lineage metadata tracks the origin and changes to data, and its dependencies, \\nover time. As data flows through the data engineering lifecycle, it evolves through \\ntransformations and combinations with other data. Data lineage provides an audit trail \\nof data’s evolution as it moves through various systems and workflows. \\nSchema metadata describes the structure of data stored in a system such as a database, \\na data warehouse, a data lake, or a filesystem; it is one of the key differentiators across \\ndifferent storage systems. Object stores, for example, don’t manage schema metadata; \\ninstead, this must be managed in a metastore. On the other hand, cloud data warehouses \\nmanage schema metadata internally. \\nThese are just a few examples of technical metadata that a data engineer should know \\nabout. This is not a complete list, and we cover additional aspects of technical metadata \\nthroughout the book. \\nOperational metadata describes the operational results of various systems and includes \\nstatistics about processes, job IDs, application runtime logs, data used in a process, and \\nerror logs. A data engineer uses operational metadata to determine whether a process \\nsucceeded or failed and the data involved in the process. \\nOrchestration systems can provide a limited picture of operational metadata, but the \\nlatter still tends to be scattered across many systems. A need for better -quality \\noperational metadata, and better metadata management, is a major motivation for next-\\ngeneration orchestration and metadata management systems. \\nReference metadata is data used to classify other data.

The process for converting data into a usable form is \\nknown as data modeling and design. Whereas we traditionally think of data modeling \\nas a problem for database administrators (DBAs) and ETL developers, data modeling \\ncan happen almost anywhere in an organization. Firmware engineers develop the data \\nformat of a record for an IoT device, or web application developers design the JSON \\nresponse to an API call or a MySQL table schema —these are all instances of data \\nmodeling and design. \\nData modeling has become more challenging because of the variety of new data \\nsources and use cases. For instance, strict normalization doesn’t work well with event \\ndata. Fortunately, a new generation of data tools increases the flexibility of data \\nmodels, while retaining logical separations of measures, dimensions, attributes, and \\nhierarchies. Cloud data warehouses support the ingestion of enormous quantities of \\ndenormalized and semistructured data, while still supporting common data modeling \\npatterns, such as Kimball, Inmon, and Data Vault. Data processing frameworks such \\nas Spark can ingest a whole spectrum of data, from flat structured relational records to \\nraw unstructured text. We discuss these data modeling and transformation patterns in \\ngreater detail in Chapter 8. \\nWith the wide variety of data that engineers must cope with, there is a temptation to \\nthrow up our hands and give up on data modeling.

However, it’s now being more widely adopted in smaller companies as data \\nmanagement becomes mainstream. We also note that Andy Petrella’s concept of Data \\nObservability Driven Development (DODD) is closely related to data lineage. DODD \\nobserves data all along its lineage. This process is applied during development, testing, \\nand finally production to deliver quality and conformity to expectations. \\nData integration and interoperability \\nData integration and interoperability is the process of integrating data across tools and \\nprocesses. As we move away from a single -stack approach to analytics and toward a \\nheterogeneous cloud environment in which various tools process data on demand, \\nintegration and interoperability occupy an ever-widening swath of the data engineer’s \\njob. \\nIncreasingly, integration happens through general -purpose APIs rather than custom \\ndatabase connections. For example, a data pipeline might pull data from the Salesforce \\nAPI, store it to Amazon S3, call the Snowflake API to load it into a table, call the API \\nagain to run a query, and then export the results to S3 where Spark can consume them. \\nAll of this activity can be managed with relatively simple Python code that talks to data \\nsystems rather than handling data directly.

Whereas DevOps aims to improve the release and quality of \\nsoftware products, DataOps does the same thing for data products. \\nData products differ from software products because of the way data is used. A software \\nproduct provides specific functionality and technical features for end users. By \\ncontrast, a data product is built around sound business logic and metrics, whose users \\nmake decisions or build models that perform automated actions. A data engineer must \\nunderstand both the technical aspects of building software products and the business \\nlogic, quality, and metrics that will create excellent data products. \\nLike DevOps, DataOps borrows much from lean manufacturing and supply chain \\nmanagement, mixing people, processes, and technology to reduce time to value. As \\nData Kitchen (experts in DataOps) describes it:19 \\nDataOps is a collection of technical practices, workflows, cultural norms, and \\narchitectural patterns that enable: \\n• Rapid innovation and experimentation delivering new insights to customers with \\nincreasing velocity \\n• Extremely high data quality and very low error rates \\n• Collaboration across complex arrays of people, technology, and environments \\n• Clear measurement, monitoring, and transparency of results \\nLean practices (such as lead time reduction and minimizing defects) and the resulting \\nimprovements to quality and productivity are things we are glad to see gaining \\nmomentum both in software and data operations. \\nFirst and foremost, DataOps is a set of cultural habits; the data engineering team needs \\nto adopt a cycle of communicating and collaborating with the business, breaking down \\nsilos, continuously learning from successes and mistakes, and rapid iteration. Onl y \\nwhen these cultural habits are set in place can the team get the best results from \\ntechnology and tools. \\nDepending on a company’s data maturity, a data engineer has some options to build \\nDataOps into the fabric of the overall data engineering lifecycle. If the company has \\nno preexisting data infrastructure or practices, DataOps is very much a greenfield \\nopportunity that can be baked in from day one. With an existing project or \\ninfrastructure that lacks DataOps, a data engineer can begin adding DataOps into \\nworkflows.

A \\ndata engineer may work alongside an existing DataOps team to improve the data \\nengineering lifecycle in a data-mature company. In all cases, a data engineer must be \\naware of the philosophy and technical aspects of DataOps. \\nDataOps has three core technical elements: automation, monitoring and observability, \\nand incident response ( Figure 2-8). Let’s look at each of these pieces and how they \\nrelate to the data engineering lifecycle. \\n \\nFigure 2-8. The three pillars of DataOps \\nAutomation \\nAutomation enables reliability and consistency in the DataOps process and allows data \\nengineers to quickly deploy new product features and improvements to existing \\nworkflows. DataOps automation has a similar framework and workflow to DevOps, \\nconsisting of change management (environment, code, and data version control), \\ncontinuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), and configuration as code. \\nLike DevOps, DataOps practices monitor and maintain the reliability of technology \\nand systems (data pipelines, orchestration, etc.), with the added dimension of checking \\nfor data quality, data/model drift, metadata integrity, and more. \\nLet’s briefly discuss the evolution of DataOps automation within a hypothetical \\norganization. An organization with a low level of DataOps maturity often attempts to \\nschedule multiple stages of data transformation processes using cron jobs. This works \\nwell for a while. As data pipelines become more complicated, several things are likely \\nto happen. If the cron jobs are hosted on a cloud instance, the instance may have an \\noperational problem, causing the jobs to stop running unexpectedly. As the spacing \\nbetween jobs becomes tighter, a job will eventually run long, causing a subsequent job \\nto fail or produce stale data. Engineers may not be aware of job failures until they hear \\nfrom analysts that their reports are out-of-date. \\nAs the organization’s data maturity grows, data engineers will typically adopt an \\norchestration framework, perhaps Airflow or Dagster. Data engineers are aware that \\nAirflow presents an operational burden, but the benefits of orchestration eventually \\noutweigh the complexity. Engineers will gradually migrate their cron jobs to Airflow \\njobs. Now, dependencies are checked before jobs run. More transformation jobs can \\nbe packed into a given time because each job can start as soon as upstream data is \\nready rather than at a fixed, predetermined time.'),\n",

A data scientist \\neventually deploys a broken DAG, bringing down the Airflow web server and leaving \\nthe data team operationally blind. After enough such headaches, the data engineering \\nteam members realize that they need to stop allowing manual DAG deployments. In \\ntheir next phase of operational maturity, they adopt automated DAG deployment. \\nDAGs are tested before deployment, and monitoring processes ensure that the new \\nDAGs start running properly. In addition, data engineers block the deployment of new \\nPython dependencies until installation is validated. After automation is adopted, the \\ndata team is much happier and experiences far fewer headaches. \\nOne of the tenets of the DataOps Manifesto is “Embrace change.” This does not mean \\nchange for the sake of change but rather goal -oriented change. At each stage of our \\nautomation journey, opportunities exist for operational improvement. Even at the high \\nlevel of maturity that we’ve described here, f urther room for improvement remains. \\nEngineers might embrace a next -generation orchestration framework that builds in \\nbetter metadata capabilities. Or they might try to develop a framework that builds \\nDAGs automatically based on data -lineage specifications . The main point is that \\nengineers constantly seek to implement improvements in automation that will reduce \\ntheir workload and increase the value that they deliver to the business. \\nObservability and monitoring \\nAs we tell our clients, “Data is a silent killer.” We’ve seen countless examples of bad \\ndata lingering in reports for months or years. Executives may make key decisions from \\nthis bad data, discovering the error only much later. The outcomes are usually bad and \\nsometimes catastrophic for the business. Initiatives are undermined and destroyed, \\nyears of work wasted. In some of the worst cases, bad data may lead companies to \\nfinancial ruin. \\nAnother horror story occurs when the systems that create the data for reports randomly \\nstop working, resulting in reports being delayed by several days. The data team doesn’t \\nknow until they’re asked by stakeholders why reports are late or producing stale \\ninformation. Eventually, various stakeholders lose trust in the capabilities of the core \\ndata team and start their own splinter teams. The result is many different unstable \\nsystems, inconsistent reports, and silos. \\nIf you’re not observing and monitoring your data and the systems that produce the data, \\nyou’re inevitably going to experience your own data horror story. Observability, \\nmonitoring, logging, alerting, and tracing are all critical to getting ahead of any \\nproblems along the data engineering lifecycle. We recommend you incorporate SPC to \\nunderstand whether events being monitored are out of line and which incidents are \\nworth responding to.'),\n",

The up-front effort will see \\na significant long-term payoff through faster delivery of products, better reliability and \\naccuracy of data, and greater overall value for the business. \\nThe state of operations in data engineering is still quite immature compared with \\nsoftware engineering. Many data engineering tools, especially legacy monoliths, are \\nnot automation-first. A recent movement has arisen to adopt automation best practices \\nacross the data engineering lifecycle.

Because an organization’s data \\nrequirements will likely change rapidly, and new tools and practices seem to arrive on \\na near-daily basis, data engineers must understand good data architecture. Chapter 3 \\ncovers data architecture in depth, but we want to highlight here that data architecture \\nis an undercurrent of the data engineering lifecycle. \\nA data engineer should first understand the needs of the business and gather \\nrequirements for new use cases. Next, a data engineer needs to translate those \\nrequirements to design new ways to capture and serve data, balanced for cost and \\noperational simplic ity.

So, what is orchestration? \\nOrchestration is the process of coordinating many jobs to run as quickly and efficiently \\nas possible on a scheduled cadence. For instance, people often refer to orchestration \\ntools like Apache Airflow as schedulers. This isn’t quite accurate. A pure scheduler, \\nsuch as cron, is aware only of time; an orchestration engine builds in metadata on job \\ndependencies, generally in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The DAG can \\nbe run once or scheduled to run at a fixed interval of daily, weekly, every hour, every \\nfive minutes, etc. \\nAs we discuss orchestration throughout this book, we assume that an orchestration \\nsystem stays online with high availability. This allows the orchestration system to sense \\nand monitor constantly without human intervention and run new jobs anytime they are \\ndeployed. An orchestration system monitors jobs that it manages and kicks off new \\ntasks as internal DAG dependencies are completed. It can also monitor external \\nsystems and tools to watch for data to arrive and criteria to be met. When certain \\nconditions go out of bounds, the system also sets error conditions and sends alerts \\nthrough email or other channels. You might set an expected completion time of 10 a.m. \\nfor overnight daily data pipelines. If jobs are not done by this time, alerts go out to data \\nengineers and consumers. \\nOrchestration systems also build job history capabilities, visualization, and alerting. \\nAdvanced orchestration engines can backfill new DAGs or individual tasks as they are \\nadded to a DAG. They also support dependencies over a time range. For example, a \\nmonthly reporting job might check that an ETL job has been completed for the full \\nmonth before starting. \\nOrchestration has long been a key capability for data processing but was not often top \\nof mind nor accessible to anyone except the largest companies. Enterprises used \\nvarious tools to manage job flows, but these were expensive, out of reach of small \\nstartups, and generally not extensible. Apache Oozie was extremely popular in the \\n2010s, but it was designed to work within a Hadoop cluster and was difficult to use in \\na more heterogeneous environment. Facebook developed Dataswarm for internal use \\nin the late 2000s; this inspired popular tools such as Airflow, introduced by Airbnb in \\n2014. \\nAirflow was open source from its inception and was widely adopted. It was written in \\nPython, making it highly extensible to almost any use case imaginable.

Some of the most interesting \\nexamples are Prefect and Dagster, which aim to improve the portability and testability \\nof DAGs to allow engineers to move from local development to production more \\neasily. Argo is an orchestration engine built around Kubernetes primitives; Metaflow \\nis an open source project out of Netflix that aims to improve data science orchestration. \\nWe must point out that orchestration is strictly a batch concept. The streaming \\nalternative to orchestrated task DAGs is the streaming DAG. Streaming DAGs remain \\nchallenging to build and maintain, but next -generation streaming platforms such as \\nPulsar aim to dramatically reduce the engineering and operational burden. We talk \\nmore about these developments in Chapter 8. \\nSoftware Engineering \\nSoftware engineering has always been a central skill for data engineers. In the early \\ndays of contemporary data engineering (2000 –2010), data engineers worked on \\nlowlevel frameworks and wrote MapReduce jobs in C, C++, and Java. At the peak of \\nthe big data era (the mid-2010s), engineers started using frameworks that abstracted \\naway these low-level details. \\nThis abstraction continues today. Cloud data warehouses support powerful \\ntransformations using SQL semantics; tools like Spark have become more user -\\nfriendly, transitioning away from low -level coding details and toward easy -to-use \\ndataframes. Despite this abstraction, software engineering is still critical to data \\nengineering. We want to briefly discuss a few common areas of software engineering \\nthat apply to the data engineering lifecycle. \\nCore data processing code \\nThough it has become more abstract and easier to manage, core data processing code \\nstill needs to be written, and it appears throughout the data engineering lifecycle. \\nWhether in ingestion, transformation, or data serving, data engineers need to be highly \\nproficient and productive in frameworks and languages such as Spark, SQL, or Beam; \\nwe reject the notion that SQL is not code. \\nIt’s also imperative that a data engineer understand proper code-testing methodologies, \\nsuch as unit, regression, integration, end-to-end, and smoke.'),\n",

These tools primarily focused on transforming and serving \\nparts of the data engineering lifecycle. Data engineering tool speciation has not ceased \\nor slowed down, but the emphasis has shifted up the ladder of abstraction, away from \\ndirect data processing. This new generation of open source tools assists engineers in \\nmanaging, enhancing, connecting, optimizing, and monitoring data. \\nFor example, Airflow dominated the orchestration space from 2015 until the early \\n2020s. Now, a new batch of open source competitors (including Prefect, Dagster, and \\nMetaflow) has sprung up to fix perceived limitations of Airflow, providing better \\nmetadata handling, portability, and dependency management. Where the future of \\norchestration goes is anyone’s guess. \\nBefore data engineers begin engineering new internal tools, they would do well to \\nsurvey the landscape of publicly available tools. Keep an eye on the total cost of \\nownership (TCO) and opportunity cost associated with implementing a tool. There is \\na good chance that an open source project already exists to address the problem they’re \\nlooking to solve, and they would do well to collaborate rather than reinventing the \\nwheel. \\nStreaming \\nStreaming data processing is inherently more complicated than batch, and the tools and \\nparadigms are arguably less mature. As streaming data becomes more pervasive in \\nevery stage of the data engineering lifecycle, data engineers face interesting software \\nengineering problems. \\nFor instance, data processing tasks such as joins that we take for granted in the batch \\nprocessing world often become more complicated in real time, requiring more complex \\nsoftware engineering. Engineers must also write code to apply a variety of windowing \\nmethods. Windowing allows real-time systems to calculate valuable metrics such as \\ntrailing statistics. Engineers have many frameworks to choose from, including various \\nfunction platforms (OpenFaaS, AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) for handling \\nindividual events or dedicated stream processors (Spark, Beam, Flink, or Pulsar) for \\nanalyzing streams to support reporting and real-time actions.'),\n",

When data engineers have to manage their infrastructure in a cloud \\nenvironment, they increasingly do this through IaC frameworks rather than manually \\nspinning up instances and instal ling software. Several general -purpose and \\ncloudplatform-specific frameworks allow automated infrastructure deployment based \\non a set of specifications.

In both cases, the \\narchitecture crosses multiple systems, and multiple functional groups within the \\nenterprise. \\n \\n22 The Open Group, TOGAF Version 9.1, https://oreil.ly/A1H67.'),\n",

Among other things, it is responsible for the \\n(in)famous Gartner Hype Cycle. Gartner’s definition is as follows:23 \\nEnterprise architecture (EA) is a discipline for proactively and holistically leading \\nenterprise responses to disruptive forces by identifying and analyzing the execution of \\nchange toward desired business vision and outcomes. EA delivers value by presenting \\nbusiness and IT leaders with signature -ready recommendations for adjusting policies \\nand projects to achieve targeted business outcomes that capitalize on relevant business \\ndisruptions. \\nEABOK’s definition \\nEABOK is the Enterprise Architecture Book of Knowledge, an enterprise architecture \\nreference produced by the MITRE Corporation. EABOK was released as an \\nincomplete draft in 2004 and has not been updated since. Though seemingly obsolete, \\nEABOK is frequently referenced in descriptions of enterprise architecture ; we found \\nmany of its ideas helpful while writing this book. Here’s the EABOK definition:24 \\nEnterprise Architecture (EA) is an organizational model; an abstract representation of \\nan Enterprise that aligns strategy, operations, and technology to create a roadmap for \\nsuccess. \\nOur definition \\nWe extract a few common threads in these definitions of enterprise architecture: \\nchange, alignment, organization, opportunities, problem-solving, and migration. Here \\nis our definition of enterprise architecture, one that we feel is more relevant to today’s \\nfast-moving data landscape: \\nEnterprise architecture is the design of systems to support change in the enterprise , \\nachieved by flexible and reversible decisions  reached through careful evaluation of \\ntrade-offs. \\nHere, we touch on some key areas we’ll return to throughout the book: flexible and \\nreversible decisions, change management, and evaluation of trade -offs. We discuss \\neach theme at length in this section and then make the definition more concrete in the \\nlatter part of the chapter by giving various examples of data architecture. Flexible and \\nreversible decisions are essential for two reasons. First, the world is constantly \\nchanging, and predicting the future is impossible. Reversible decisions allow you to \\nadjust course as the world changes and you gather new information.

Adopting a \\nculture of reversible decisions helps overcome this tendency by reducing the risk \\nattached to a decision. \\nJeff Bezos is credited with the idea of one-way and two-way doors.25 A one-way door \\nis a decision that is almost impossible to reverse. For example, Amazon could have \\ndecided to sell AWS or shut it down. It would be nearly impossible for Amazon to \\nrebuild a public cloud with the same market position after such an action. \\nOn the other hand, a two-way door is an easily reversible decision: you walk through \\nand proceed if you like what you see in the room or step back through the door if you \\ndon’t. Amazon might decide to require the use of DynamoDB for a new microservices \\ndatabase. If this policy doesn’t wor k, Amazon has the option of reversing it and \\nrefactoring some services to use other databases. Since the stakes attached to each \\nreversible decision (two-way door) are low, organizations can make more decisions, \\niterating, improving, and collecting data rapidly. \\nChange management is closely related to reversible decisions and is a central theme of \\nenterprise architecture frameworks. Even with an emphasis on reversible decisions, \\nenterprises often need to undertake large initiatives. These are ideally broken into \\nsmaller changes, each one a reversible decision in itself. Returning to Amazon, we note \\na five-year gap (2007 to 2012) from the publication of a paper on the DynamoDB \\nconcept to Werner V ogels’s announcement of the DynamoDB service on AWS. Behind \\nthe scenes, teams took numerous small actions to make DynamoDB a concrete reality \\nfor AWS customers. Managing such small actions is at the heart of change \\nmanagement. \\nArchitects are not simply mapping out IT processes and vaguely looking toward a \\ndistant, utopian future; they actively solve business problems and create new \\nopportunities. Technical solutions exist not for their own sake but in support of \\nbusiness goals. Architects identify problems in the current state (poor data quality, \\nscalability limits, money-losing lines of business), define desired future states (agile \\ndata-quality improvement, scalable cloud data solutions, improved business \\nprocesses), and realize initiatives through execution of small, concrete steps. It bears \\nrepeating: \\nTechnical solutions exist not for their own sake but in support of business goals. \\nWe found significant inspiration in Fundamentals of Software Architecture by Mark \\nRichards and Neal Ford (O’Reilly).

Sometimes the relatively fluid nature of software \\nand data leads us to believe that we are freed from the constraints that engineers face \\nin the hard, cold physical world. Indeed, this is partially true; patching a software bug \\nis much easier than redesigning and replacing an airplane wing. However, digital \\nsystems are ultimately constrained by physical limits such as latency, reliability, \\ndensity, and energy consumption. Engineers also confront various nonphysical limits, \\nsuch as characteristics of programming languages and frameworks, and practical \\nconstraints in managing complexity, budgets, etc. Magical thinking culminates in poor \\nengineering. Data engineers must account for trade -offs at every step to design an \\noptimal system while minimizing high-interest technical debt. \\nLet’s reiterate one central point in our enterprise architecture definition: enterprise \\narchitecture balances flexibility and trade-offs.

Just as the data engineering \\nlifecycle is a subset of the data lifecycle, data engineering architecture is a subset of \\ngeneral data architecture. Data engineering architecture  is the systems and \\nframeworks that make up the key sections of the data engineering lifecycle. We’ll use \\ndata architecture interchangeably with data engineering architecture throughout this \\nbook. \\nOther aspects of data architecture that you should be aware of are operational and \\ntechnical ( Figure 3 -2). Operational architecture  encompasses the functional \\nrequirements of what needs to happen related to people, processes, and technology. \\nFor example, what business processes does the data serve? How does the organization \\nmanage data quality? What is the latency requirement from when the data is produced \\nto when it becomes available to query? Technical architecture outlines how data is \\ningested, stored, transformed, and served along the data engineering lifecycle. For \\ninstance, how will you move 10 TB of data every hour from a source database to your \\ndata lake? In short, operational architecture describes what needs to be done, and \\ntechnical architecture details how it will happen. \\n \\nFigure 3-2.

When architects choose well \\nand lead effectively, common components become a fabric facilitating team \\ncollaboration and breaking down silos. Common components enable agility within and \\nacross teams in conjunction with shared knowledge and skills. \\nCommon components can be anything that has broad applicability within an \\norganization. Common components include object storage, version -control systems, \\nobservability, monitoring and orchestration systems, and processing engines. Common \\ncomponents should be accessible to everyone with an appropriate use case, and teams \\nare encouraged to rely on common components already in use rather than reinventing \\nthe wheel. Common components must support robust permissions and security to \\nenable sharing of assets among teams while preventing unauthorized access. \\nCloud platforms are an ideal place to adopt common components.

On the one hand, you need to focus \\non needs across the data engineering lifecycle and teams, utilize common components \\nthat will be useful for individual projects, and simultaneously facilitate interoperation \\nand collaboration.

Even so, any hardware component will \\nfail, given enough time. To build highly robust data systems, you must consider failures \\nin your designs. Here are a few key terms for evaluating failure scenarios; we describe \\nthese in greater detail in this chapter and throughout the book: \\nAvailability \\nThe percentage of time an IT service or component is in an operable state. \\nReliability \\nThe system’s probability of meeting defined standards in performing its intended \\nfunction during a specified interval. \\nRecovery time objective \\nThe maximum acceptable time for a service or system outage. The recovery time \\nobjective (RTO) is generally set by determining the business impact of an outage. \\nAn RTO of one day might be fine for an internal reporting system. A website \\noutage of just five minutes could have a significant adverse business impact on an \\nonline retailer. \\nRecovery point objective \\nThe acceptable state after recovery. In data systems, data is often lost during an \\noutage. In this setting, the recovery point objective (RPO) refers to the maximum \\nacceptable data loss. \\nEngineers need to consider acceptable reliability, availability, RTO, and RPO in \\ndesigning for failure. These will guide their architecture decisions as they assess \\npossible failure scenarios. \\n \\n29 UberPulse, “Amazon.com CTO: Everything Fails,” YouTube video, 3:03, https://oreil.ly/vDVlX.'),\n",

First, scalable systems \\ncan scale up to handle significant quantities of data. We might need to spin up a large \\ncluster to train a model on a petabyte of customer data or scale out a streaming ingestion \\nsystem to handle a transient load spike. Our ability to scale up allows us to handle \\nextreme loads temporarily. Second, scalable systems can scale down. Once the load \\nspike ebbs, we should automatically remove capacity to cut costs. (This is rela ted to \\nprinciple 9.) An elastic system can scale dynamically in response to load, ideally in an \\nautomated fashion. \\nSome scalable systems can also scale to zero: they shut down completely when not in \\nuse. Once the large model -training job completes, we can delete the cluster. Many \\nserverless systems (e.g., serverless functions and serverless online analytical \\nprocessing, or OLAP , databases) can automatically scale to zero. \\nNote that deploying inappropriate scaling strategies can result in overcomplicated \\nsystems and high costs. A straightforward relational database with one failover node \\nmay be appropriate for an application instead of a complex cluster arrangement. \\nMeasure your current load, approximate load spikes, and estimate load over the next \\nseveral years to determine if your database architecture is appropriate. If your startup \\ngrows much faster than anticipated, this growth should also lead to more available \\nresources to rearchitect for scalability. \\nPrinciple 4: Architecture Is Leadership \\nData architects are responsible for technology decisions and architecture descriptions \\nand disseminating these choices through effective leadership and training. Data \\narchitects should be highly technically competent but delegate most individual \\ncontributor work to others. Strong leadership skills combined with high technical \\ncompetence are rare and extremely valuable. The best data architects take this duality \\nseriously. \\nNote that leadership does not imply a command-and-control approach to technology. \\nIt was not uncommon in the past for architects to choose one proprietary database \\ntechnology and force every team to house their data there. We oppose this approach \\nbecause it can significantly hinder current data projects. Cloud environments allow \\narchitects to balance common component choices with flexibility that enables \\ninnovation within projects.'),\n",

They possess the technical \\nskills of a data engineer but no longer practice data engineering day to day; they mentor \\ncurrent data engineers, make careful technology choices in consultation with the ir \\norganization, and disseminate expertise through training and leadership. They train \\nengineers in best practices and bring the company’s engineering resources together to \\npursue common goals in both technology and business. \\nAs a data engineer, you should practice architecture leadership and seek mentorship \\nfrom architects. Eventually, you may well occupy the architect role yourself. \\nPrinciple 5: Always Be Architecting \\nWe borrow this principle directly from Google Cloud’s Five Principles for CloudNative \\nArchitecture. Data architects don’t serve in their role simply to maintain the existing \\nstate; instead, they constantly design new and exciting things in response to changes in \\nbusiness and technology. Per the EABOK, an architect’s job is to develop deep \\nknowledge of the baseline architecture (current state), develop a target architecture, \\nand map out a sequencing plan to determine priorities and the order of architecture \\nchanges. \\nWe add that modern architecture should not be command-and-control or waterfall but \\ncollaborative and agile. The data architect maintains a target architecture and \\nsequencing plans that change over time. The target architecture becomes a moving \\ntarget, adju sted in response to business and technology changes internally and \\nworldwide. The sequencing plan determines immediate priorities for delivery. \\nPrinciple 6: Build Loosely Coupled Systems \\nWhen the architecture of the system is designed to enable teams to test, deploy, and \\nchange systems without dependencies on other teams, teams require little \\ncommunication to get work done. In other words, both the architecture and the teams \\nare loosely coupled. \\n—Google DevOps tech architecture guide31 \\n \\n30 Martin Fowler, “Who Needs an Architect?” IEEE Software, July/August 2003, https://oreil.ly/wAMmZ. \\n31 Google Cloud, “DevOps Tech: Architecture,” Cloud Architecture Center, https://oreil.ly/j4MT1.'),\n",

All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service \\ninterfaces. \\n2. Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces. \\n3. There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct \\nlinking, no direct reads of another team’s data store, no shared-memory model, no \\nback-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface \\ncalls over the network. \\n4. It doesn’t matter what technology they use. HTTP, Corba, Pubsub, custom \\nprotocols—doesn’t matter. \\n5. All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to \\nbe externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose \\nthe interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions. \\nThe advent of Bezos’s API Mandate is widely viewed as a watershed moment for \\nAmazon. Putting data and services behind APIs enabled the loose coupling and \\neventually resulted in AWS as we know it now. Google’s pursuit of loose coupling \\nallowed it to grow its systems to an extraordinary scale. \\nFor software architecture, a loosely coupled system has the following properties: \\n1. Systems are broken into many small components. \\n2. These systems interface with other services through abstraction layers, such as a \\nmessaging bus or an API. These abstraction layers hide and protect internal details \\nof the service, such as a database backend or internal classes and method \\ncalls. \\n3. As a consequence of property 2, internal changes to a system component don’t \\nrequire changes in other parts. Details of code updates are hidden behind stable \\nAPIs. Each piece can evolve and improve separately. \\n4. As a consequence of property 3, there is no waterfall, global release cycle for the \\nwhole system. Instead, each component is updated separately as changes and \\nimprovements are made. \\nNotice that we are talking about technical systems. We need to think bigger.

Many small teams engineer a large, complex system. Each team is tasked with \\nengineering, maintaining, and improving some system components. \\n2. These teams publish the abstract details of their components to other teams via \\nAPI definitions, message schemas, etc. Teams need not concern themselves with \\nother teams’ components; they simply use the published API or message \\nspecifications to call these  components. They iterate their part to improve their \\nperformance and capabilities over time. They might also publish new capabilities \\nas they are added or request new stuff from other teams. Again, the latter happens \\nwithout teams needing to worry about the internal technical details of the requested \\nfeatures. Teams work together through loosely coupled communication. \\n3. As a consequence of characteristic 2, each team can rapidly evolve and improve \\nits component independently of the work of other teams. \\n4. Specifically, characteristic 3 implies that teams can release updates to their \\ncomponents with minimal downtime. Teams release continuously during regular \\nworking hours to make code changes and test them. \\nLoose coupling of both technology and human systems will allow your data \\nengineering teams to more efficiently collaborate with one another and with other \\nparts of the company. This principle also directly facilitates principle 7. \\nPrinciple 7: Make Reversible Decisions \\nThe data landscape is changing rapidly. Today’s hot technology or stack is tomorrow’s \\nafterthought. Popular opinion shifts quickly. You should aim for reversible decisions, \\nas these tend to simplify your architecture and keep it agile. \\nAs Fowler wrote, “One of an architect’s most important tasks is to remove architecture \\nby finding ways to eliminate irreversibility in software designs.”33 What was true when \\nFowler wrote this in 2003 is just as accurate today. \\nAs we said previously, Bezos refers to reversible decisions as “two-way doors.” As he \\nsays, “If you walk through and don’t like what you see on the other side, you can’t get \\nback to before. We can call these Type 1 decisions. But most decisions aren’t like that—\\nthey are changeable, reversible —they’re two -way doors.” Aim for two -way doors \\nwhenever possible. \\nGiven the pace of change—and the decoupling/modularization of technologies across \\nyour data architecture—always strive to pick the best-of-breed solutions that work for \\ntoday. Also, be prepared to upgrade or adopt better practices as the landscape evolves. \\n \\n33 Fowler, “Who Needs an Architect?”'),\n",

We focus now on two main ideas: zero-trust security and the shared \\nresponsibility security model. These align closely to a cloud-native architecture. \\nHardened-perimeter and zero-trust security models \\nTo define zero-trust security, it’s helpful to start by understanding the traditional hard-\\nperimeter security model and its limitations, as detailed in Google Cloud’s Five \\nPrinciples:34 \\nTraditional architectures place a lot of faith in perimeter security, crudely a hardened \\nnetwork perimeter with “trusted things” inside and “untrusted things” outside. \\nUnfortunately, this approach has always been vulnerable to insider attacks, as well as \\nexternal threats such as spear phishing. \\nThe 1996 film Mission Impossible presents a perfect example of the hard -perimeter \\nsecurity model and its limitations. In the movie, the CIA hosts highly sensitive data on \\na storage system inside a room with extremely tight physical security. Ethan Hunt \\ninfiltrates CIA headquarters and exploits a human target to gain physical access to the \\nstorage system. Once inside the secure room, he can exfiltrate data with relative ease. \\nFor at least a decade, alarming media reports have made us aware of the growing \\nmenace of security breaches that exploit human targets inside hardened organizational \\nsecurity perimeters. Even as employees work on highly secure corporate networks, they \\nremain connected to the outside world through email and mobile devices. External \\nthreats effectively become internal threats. \\nIn a cloud-native environment, the notion of a hardened perimeter erodes further.

In an on -\\npremises setting, data systems are generally acquired with a capital expenditure \\n(described more in Chapter 4) for a new system every few years in an on -premises \\nsetting. Responsible parties have to balance their budget against desired compute and \\nstorage capacity. Overbuying entails wasted money, while underbuying means \\nhampering future data projects and driving significant personnel time to control system \\nload and data size ; underbuying may require faster technology refresh cycles, with \\nassociated extra costs. \\nIn the cloud era, most data systems are pay -as-you-go and readily scalable. Systems \\ncan run on a cost -per-query model, cost -per-processing-capacity model, or another \\nvariant of a pay -as-you-go model. This approach can be far more efficient than the \\ncapital expenditure approach. It is now possible to scale up for high performance, and \\nthen scale down to save money. However, the pay-as-you-go approach makes spending \\nfar more dynamic. The new challenge for data leaders is to manage budgets, priorities, \\nand efficiency. \\nCloud tooling necessitates a set of processes for managing spending and resources. In \\nthe past, data engineers thought in terms of performance engineering—maximizing the \\nperformance for data processes on a fixed set of resources and buying adequate \\nresources for future needs. With FinOps, engineers need to learn to think about the cost \\nstructures of cloud systems. For example, what is the appropriate mix of AWS spot \\ninstances when running a distributed cluster?

Rather than simply monitor requests and CPU utilization for a web server, \\nFinOps might monitor the ongoing cost of serverless functions handling traffic, as well \\nas spikes in spending trigger alerts. Just as systems are designed to fail gracefully in \\nexcessive traffic, companies may consider adopting hard limits for spending, with \\ngraceful failure modes in response to spending spikes. \\nOps teams should also think in terms of cost attacks.

A domain is the real-world subject \\narea for which you’re architecting. A service is a set of functionality whose goal is to \\naccomplish a task. For example, you might have a sales order-processing service whose \\ntask is to process orders as they are created. The sales order -processing service’s only \\njob is to process orders; it doesn’t provide other functionality, such as in ventory \\nmanagement or updating user profiles. \\nA domain can contain multiple services. For example, you might have a sales domain \\nwith three services: orders, invoicing, and products. Each service has particular tasks \\nthat support the sales domain. Other domains may also share services ( Figure 3-3). In \\nthis case, the accounting domain is responsible for basic accounting functions: \\ninvoicing, payroll, and accounts receivable (AR).

On the other hand, dynamic scaling helps ensure \\nadequate p erformance without manual intervention from engineers —elasticity \\nimproves reliability. \\nScalability can be realized in a variety of ways. For your services and domains, does a \\nsingle machine handle everything? A single machine can be scaled vertically; you can \\nincrease resources (CPU, disk, memory, I/O). But there are hard limits to possible \\nresources on a single machine. Also, what happens if this machine dies? Given enough \\ntime, some components will eventually fail. What’s your plan for backup and failover? \\nSingle machines generally can’t offer high availability and reliability. We utilize a  \\ndistributed system to realize higher overall scaling capacity and increased availability \\nand reliability. Horizontal scaling allows you to add more machines to satisfy load and \\nresource requirements (Figure 3-4). Common horizontally scaled systems have a leader \\nnode that acts as the main point of contact for the instantiation, progress, and \\ncompletion of workloads. When a workload is started, the leader node distributes tasks \\nto the worker nodes within its system, completing the tasks and returning the results to \\nthe leader node.

Let’s look at single-\\ntier and multitier architecture. \\nSingle tier.    In a single-tier architecture, your database and application are tightly \\ncoupled, residing on a single server (Figure 3-5). This server could be your laptop or a \\nsingle virtual machine (VM) in the cloud. The tightly coupled nature means if the \\nserver, the database, or the application fails, the entire architecture fails. While single-\\ntier architectures are good for prototypi ng and development, they are not advised for \\nproduction environments because of the obvious failure risks. \\n \\nFigure 3-5. Single-tier architecture \\nEven when single -tier architectures build in redundancy (for example, a failover \\nreplica), they present significant limitations in other ways. For instance, it is often \\nimpractical (and not advisable) to run analytics queries against production application \\ndatabases. Doing so risks overwhelming the database and causing the application to \\nbecome unavailable. A single -tier architecture is fine for testing systems on a local \\nmachine but is not advised for production uses. \\nMultitier.    The challenges of a tightly coupled single-tier architecture are solved by \\ndecoupling the data and application. A multitier (also known as n-tier) architecture is \\ncomposed of separate layers: data, application, business logic, presentation, etc. These \\nlayers are bottom -up and hierarchical, meaning the lower layer isn’t necessarily \\ndependent on the upper layers; the upper layers depend on the lower layers. The notion \\nis to separate data from the application, and application from the presentation. \\nA common multitier architecture is a three-tier architecture, a widely used clientserver \\ndesign. A three-tier architecture consists of data, application logic, and presentation \\ntiers ( Figure 3 -6). Each tier is isolated from the other, allowing for separation of \\nconcerns.

A three-tier architecture \\nWe’ve seen many single-tier architectures in production. Single-tier architectures offer \\nsimplicity but also severe limitations. Eventually, an organization or application \\noutgrows this arrangement; it works well until it doesn’t. For instance, in a single -tier \\narchitecture, the data and logic layers share and compete for resources (disk, CPU, and \\nmemory) in ways that are simply avoided in a multitier architecture. Resources are \\nspread across various tiers. Data engineers should use tiers to evaluate their layered \\narchitecture and the way dependencies are handled. Again, start simple and bake in \\nevolution to additional tiers as your architecture becomes more complex. \\nIn a multitier architecture, you need to consider separating your layers and the way \\nresources are shared within layers when working with a distributed system. Distributed \\nsystems under the hood power many technologies you’ll encounter across the data \\nengineering lifecycle. First, think about whether you want resource contention with \\nyour nodes. If not, exercise a shared-nothing architecture: a single node handles each \\nrequest, meaning other nodes do not share resources such as memory, disk, or CPU \\nwith thi s node or with each other. Data and resources are isolated to the node. \\nAlternatively, various nodes can handle multiple requests and share resources but at the \\nrisk of resource contention. Another consideration is whether nodes should share the \\nsame disk and memory accessible by all nodes. This is called a shared disk architecture \\nand is common when you want shared resources if a random node failure \\noccurs. \\nMonoliths \\nThe general notion of a monolith includes as much as possible under one roof; in its \\nmost extreme version, a monolith consists of a single codebase running on a single \\nmachine that provides both the application logic and user interface. \\nCoupling within monoliths can be viewed in two ways: technical coupling and domain \\ncoupling.

You could have an application with various layers \\ndecoupled in a multitier architecture but still share multiple domains. Or, you could \\nhave a single-tier architecture serving a single domain. \\nThe tight coupling of a monolith implies a lack of modularity of its components. \\nSwapping out or upgrading components in a monolith is often an exercise in trading \\none pain for another. Because of the tightly coupled nature, reusing components across \\nthe a rchitecture is difficult or impossible. When evaluating how to improve a \\nmonolithic architecture, it’s often a game of whack -a-mole: one component is \\nimproved, often at the expense of unknown consequences with other areas of the \\nmonolith. \\nData teams will often ignore solving the growing complexity of their monolith, letting \\nit devolve into a big ball of mud. \\nChapter 4 provides a more extensive discussion comparing monoliths to distributed \\ntechnologies. We also discuss the distributed monolith, a strange hybrid that emerges \\nwhen engineers build distributed systems with excessive tight coupling. \\nMicroservices \\nCompared with the attributes of a monolith —interwoven services, centralization, and \\ntight coupling among services —microservices are the polar opposite. Microservices \\narchitecture comprises separate, decentralized, and loosely coupled services. Each \\nservice has a specific function and is decoupled from other services operating within \\nits domain. If one service temporarily goes down, it won’t affect the ability of other \\nservices to continue functioning. \\nA question that comes up often is how to convert your monolith into many \\nmicroservices (Figure 3-7). This completely depends on how complex your monolith \\nis and how much effort it will be to start extracting services out of it. It’s entirely \\npossible that your monolith cannot be broken apart, in which case, you’ll want to start \\ncreating a new parallel architecture that has the services decoupled in a microservices-\\nfriendly manner.

In some sense, all cloud services are multitenant, \\nalthough this multitenancy occurs at various grains. For example, a cloud compute \\ninstance is usually on a shared server, but the VM itself provides some degree of \\nisolation. Object storage is a multitenant system, but cloud vendors guarantee security \\nand isolation so long as customers configure their permissions correctly. \\nEngineers frequently need to make decisions about multitenancy at a much smaller \\nscale. For example, do multiple departments in a large company share the same data \\nwarehouse? Does the organization share data for multiple large customers within the \\nsame table? \\nWe have two factors to consider in multitenancy: performance and security. With \\nmultiple large tenants within a cloud system, will the system support consistent \\nperformance for all tenants, or will there be a noisy neighbor problem? (That is, will \\nhigh usage from one tenant degrade performance for other tenants?) Regarding security, \\ndata from different tenants must be properly isolated. When a company has multiple \\nexternal customer tenants, these tenants should not be aware of one another, and \\nengineers must prevent data leakage. Strategies for data isolation vary by system. For \\ninstance, it is often perfectly acceptable to use multitenant tables and isolate data \\nthrough views. However, you must make certain that these views cannot leak data.

This allows for \\nflexible and reversible decisions while assessing the  impact of the deprecation on \\ndependent systems. \\nIt’s important to note that deprecation might be “ivory tower” advice and not practical \\nor achievable.

Still, they are optimized to scan massive \\namounts of data in parallel and thus allow high-performance aggregation and statistical \\ncalculations. In recent years, MPP systems have increasingly shifted from a row-based \\nto a columnar architecture to facilitate even larger data and queries, especially in cloud \\ndata warehouses. MPPs are indispensable for running performant queries for large \\nenterprises as data and reporting needs grow. \\nOne variation on ETL is ELT. With the ELT data warehouse architecture, data gets \\nmoved more or less directly from production systems into a staging area in the data \\nwarehouse.

The term data lakehouse suggests a convergence \\nbetween data lakes and data warehouses. \\nThe technical architecture of cloud data warehouses has evolved to be very similar to a \\ndata lake architecture. Cloud data warehouses separate compute from storage, support \\npetabyte-scale queries, store a variety of unstructured data and semistructured objects, \\nand integrate with advanced processing technologies such as Spark or Beam. \\nWe believe that the trend of convergence will only continue. The data lake and the data \\nwarehouse will still exist as different architectures. In practice, their capabilities will \\nconverge so that few users will notice a boundary between them in their day -today \\nwork. We now see several vendors offering data platforms that combine data lake and \\ndata warehouse capabilities. From our perspective, AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, \\nSnowflake, and Databricks are class leaders, each offering a constellation of tightly \\nintegrated tools for working with data, running the gamut from relational to completely \\nunstructured. Instead of choosing between a data lake or data warehouse architecture, \\nfuture data engineers will have the option to choose a converged data platform based \\non a variety of factors, including vendor, ecosystem, and relative openness. \\nModern Data Stack \\nThe modern data stack  (Figure 3-13) is currently a trendy analytics architecture that \\nhighlights the type of abstraction we expect to see more widely used over the next \\nseveral years.

The central challenge of unifying batch and streaming data remained, \\nand Lambda and Kappa both provided inspiration and groundwork for continued \\nprogress in this pursuit. \\nOne of the central problems of managing batch and stream processing is unifying \\nmultiple code paths. While the Kappa architecture relies on a unified queuing and \\nstorage layer, one still has to confront using different tools for collecting real -time \\nstatistics or running batch aggregation jobs. Today, engineers seek to solve this in \\nseveral ways. Google made its mark by developing the Dataflow model and the Apache \\nBeam framework that implements this model. \\nThe core idea in the Dataflow model is to view all data as events, as the aggregation is \\nperformed over various types of windows. Ongoing real -time event streams are \\nunbounded data. Data batches are simply bounded event streams, and the boundaries \\nprovide a natural window. Engineers can choose from various windows for real -time \\naggregation, such as sliding or tumbling.

An IoT gateway is a hub for connecting devices and securely routing \\ndevices to the appropriate destinations on the internet.

In this case, a \\nmessage queue or time-series database is more appropriate. We discuss storage systems \\nin more detail in Chapter 6. \\nServing.    Serving patterns are incredibly diverse. In a batch scientific application, \\ndata might be analyzed using a cloud data warehouse and then served in a report. Data \\nwill be presented and served in numerous ways in a home-monitoring application. Data \\nwill be analyzed in the near time using a stream-processing engine or queries in a time-\\nseries database to look for critical events such as a fire, electrical outage, or break -in. \\nDetection of an anomaly will trigger alerts to the homeowner, the fire de partment, or \\nother entity. A batch analytics component also exists—for example, a monthly report \\non the state of the home.'),\n",

Bigger companies may still employ data \\narchitects, but those architects will need to be heavily in tune and current with the state \\nof technology and data. Gone are the days of ivory tower data architecture. In the past, \\narchitecture was largely orthogonal to engineering. We expect this distinction will \\ndisappear as data engineering, and engineering in general, quickly evolves, becoming \\nmore agile, with less separation between engineering and architecture. \\nIdeally, a data engineer will work alongside a dedicated data architect. However, if a \\ncompany is small or low in its level of data maturity, a data engineer might work double \\nduty as an architect. Because data architecture is an undercurrent of the data \\nengineering lifecycle, a data engineer should understand “good” architecture and the \\nvarious types of data architecture. \\nWhen designing architecture, you’ll work alongside business stakeholders to evaluate \\ntrade-offs. What are the trade-offs inherent in adopting a cloud data warehouse versus \\na data lake? What are the trade-offs of various cloud platforms? When might a unified \\nbatch/streaming framework (Beam, Flink) be an appropriate choice? Studying these \\nchoices in the abstract will prepare you to make concrete, valuable decisions. \\nConclusion \\nYou’ve learned how data architecture fits into the data engineering lifecycle and what \\nmakes for “good” data architecture, and you’ve seen several examples of data \\narchitectures. Because architecture is such a key foundation for success, we encourage \\nyou to invest the time to study it deeply and understand the trade-offs inherent in any \\narchitecture. You will be prepared to map out architecture that corresponds to your \\norganization’s unique requirements. \\nNext up, let’s look at some approaches to choosing the right technologies to be used in \\ndata architecture and across the data engineering lifecycle. \\nAdditional Resources \\n• “AnemicDomainModel” by Martin Fowler \\n• “Big Data Architectures” Azure documentation \\n• “BoundedContext” by Martin Fowler'),\n",

We have no \\nshortage of technologies to solve various types of data problems. Data technologies \\nare available as turnkey offerings consumable in almost every way —open source, \\nmanaged open source, proprietary software, proprietary service, and more. However, \\nit’s easy to get caught up in chasing bleeding-edge technology while losing sight of the \\ncore purpose of data engineering: designing robust and reliable systems to carry data \\nthrough the f ull lifecycle and serve it according to the needs of end users. Just as \\nstructural engineers carefully choose technologies and materials to realize an \\narchitect’s vision for a building, data engineers are tasked with making appropriate \\ntechnology choices to shepherd data through the lifecycle to serve data applications \\nand users. \\nChapter 3 discussed “good” data architecture and why it matters. We now explain how \\nto choose the right technologies to serve this architecture. Data engineers must choose \\ngood technologies to make the best possible data product. We feel the criteria to choose \\na good data technology is simple: does it add value to a data product and the broader \\nbusiness? \\nA lot of people confuse architecture and tools. Architecture is strategic; tools are \\ntactical. We sometimes hear, “Our data architecture are tools X, Y, and Z.” This is the \\nwrong way to think about architecture. Architecture is the high-level design, roadmap, \\nand blueprint of data systems that satisfy the strategic aims for the business. \\nArchitecture is the what, why, and when. Tools are used to make the architecture a \\nreality; tools are the how.'),\n",

The reasons vary: shiny object syndrome, resume -driven \\ndevelopment, and a lack of expertise in architecture. In practice, this prioritization of \\ntechnology often means they cobble together a kind of Dr. Seuss fantasy machine \\nrather than a true data architecture. We strongly advise against choosing technology \\nbefore getting your architecture right. Architecture first, technology second. This \\nchapter discusses our tactical plan for making technology choices once we have a \\nstrategic architecture blueprint. The following are some considerations for choosing \\ndata technologies across the data engineering lifecycle: \\n• Team size and capabilities \\n• Speed to market \\n• Interoperability \\n• Cost optimization and business value \\n• Today versus the future: immutable versus transitory technologies \\n• Location (cloud, on prem, hybrid cloud, multicloud) \\n• Build versus buy \\n• Monolith versus modular \\n• Serverless versus servers \\n• Optimization, performance, and the benchmark wars \\n• The undercurrents of the data engineering lifecycle \\nTeam Size and Capabilities \\nThe first thing you need to assess is your team’s size and its capabilities with \\ntechnology. Are you on a small team (perhaps a team of one) of people who are \\nexpected to wear many hats, or is the team large enough that people work in specialized \\nroles? Wi ll a handful of people be responsible for multiple stages of the data \\nengineering lifecycle, or do people cover particular niches? Your team’s size will \\ninfluence the types of technologies you adopt. \\nThere is a continuum of simple to complex technologies, and a team’s size roughly \\ndetermines the amount of bandwidth your team can dedicate to complex solutions. We \\nsometimes see small data teams read blog posts about a new cutting-edge technology \\nat a gia nt tech company and then try to emulate these same extremely complex \\ntechnologies and practices. We call this cargo-cult engineering, and it’s generally a big \\nmistake that consumes a lot of valuable time and money, often with little to nothing to \\nshow in return. Especially for small teams or teams with weaker technical chops, use'),\n",

Do people lean toward low-code tools, or do \\nthey favor code -first approaches? Are people strong in certain languages like Java, \\nPython, or Go? Technologies are available to cater to every preference on the low-code \\nto code-heavy spectrum. Again, we suggest sticking with technologies and workflows \\nwith which the team is familiar. We’ve seen data teams invest a lot of time in learning \\nthe shiny new data technology, language, or tool, only to never use it in production.  \\nLearning new technologies, languages, and tools is a considerable time investment, so \\nmake these investments wisely. \\nSpeed to Market \\nIn technology, speed to market wins. This means choosing the right technologies that \\nhelp you deliver features and data faster while maintaining high-quality standards and \\nsecurity. It also means working in a tight feedback loop of launching, learning, \\niterating, and making improvements. \\nPerfect is the enemy of good. Some data teams will deliberate on technology choices \\nfor months or years without reaching any decisions. Slow decisions and output are the \\nkiss of death to data teams. We’ve seen more than a few data teams dissolve for moving \\ntoo slow and failing to deliver the value they were hired to produce. Deliver value early \\nand often. As we’ve mentioned, use what works. Your team members will likely get \\nbetter leverage with tools they already know. Avoid undifferentiated heavy lifting that \\nengages your team in unnecessarily complex work that adds little to no value. Choose \\ntools that help you move quickly, reliably, safely, and securely. \\nInteroperability \\nRarely will you use only one technology or system. When choosing a technology or \\nsystem, you’ll need to ensure that it interacts and operates with other technologies. \\nInteroperability describes how various technologies or systems connect, exchange \\ninformation, and interact. \\nLet’s say you’re evaluating two technologies, A and B. How easily does technology \\nA integrate with technology B when thinking about interoperability? This is often a \\nspectrum of difficulty, ranging from seamless to time-intensive. Is seamless integration \\nalready baked into each product, making setup a breeze? Or do you need to do a lot of \\nmanual configuration to integrate these technologies?'),\n",

Most data ingestion and visualization tools have built-in integrations with \\npopular data warehouses and data lakes. Furthermore, popular data-ingestion \\nSpeed to Market  \\ntools will integrate with common APIs and services, such as CRMs, accounting \\nsoftware, and more. \\nSometimes standards are in place for interoperability. Almost all databases allow \\nconnections via Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) or Open Database Connectivity \\n(ODBC), meaning that you can easily connect to a database by using these standards. \\nIn other c ases, interoperability occurs in the absence of standards. Representational \\nstate transfer (REST) is not truly a standard for APIs; every REST API has its quirks. \\nIn these cases, it’s up to the vendor or open source software (OSS) project to ensure \\nsmooth integration with other technologies and systems. \\nAlways be aware of how simple it will be to connect your various technologies across \\nthe data engineering lifecycle. As mentioned in other chapters, we suggest designing \\nfor modularity and giving yourself the ability to easily swap out technologies as new \\npractices and alternatives become available. \\nCost Optimization and Business Value \\nIn a perfect world, you’d get to experiment with all the latest, coolest technologies \\nwithout considering cost, time investment, or value added to the business. In reality, \\nbudgets and time are finite, and the cost is a major constraint for choosing the ri ght \\ndata architectures and technologies. Your organization expects a positive ROI from \\nyour data projects, so you must understand the basic costs you can control. Technology \\nis a major cost driver, so your technology choices and management strategies will \\nsignificantly impact your budget. We look at costs through three main lenses: total cost \\nof ownership, opportunity cost, and FinOps. \\nTotal Cost of Ownership \\nTotal cost of ownership (TCO) is the total estimated cost of an initiative, including the \\ndirect and indirect costs of products and services utilized. Direct costs can be directly \\nattributed to an initiative. Examples are the salaries of a team working on the initiative \\nor the AWS bill for all services consumed. Indirect costs, also known as overhead, are \\nindependent of the initiative and must be paid regardless of where they’re attributed.'),\n",

Expenses fall into two big groups: capital expenses and operational \\nexpenses. \\nCapital expenses, also known as capex, require an up -front investment. Payment is \\nrequired today. Before the cloud existed, companies would typically purchase \\nhardware and software up front through large acquisition contracts. In addition, \\nsignificant investments were required to host hardware in server rooms, data centers, \\nand colocation facilities.  These up -front investments —commonly hundreds of \\nthousands to millions of dollars or more —would be treated as assets and slowly \\ndepreciate over time. From a budget perspective, capital was required to fund the entire \\npurchase. This is capex, a significant capital outlay with a long-term plan to achieve a \\npositive ROI on the effort and expense put forth. \\nOperational expenses , also known as opex, are the opposite of capex in certain \\nrespects. Opex is gradual and spread out over time. Whereas capex is long -term \\nfocused, opex is short-term. Opex can be pay-as-you-go or similar and allows a lot of \\nflexibility. Opex is closer to a direct cost, making it easier to attribute to a data project. \\nUntil recently, opex wasn’t an option for large data projects. Data systems often \\nrequired multimillion-dollar contracts. This has changed with the advent of the cloud, \\nas data platform services allow engineers to pay on a consumption -based model. In \\ngeneral, opex allows for a far greater ability for engineering teams to choose their \\nsoftware and hardware. Cloud -based services let data engineers iterate quickly with \\nvarious software and technology configurations, often inexpensively. \\nData engineers need to be pragmatic about flexibility. The data landscape is changing \\ntoo quickly to invest in long-term hardware that inevitably goes stale, can’t easily scale, \\nand potentially hampers a data engineer’s flexibility to try new things. Given the upside \\nfor flexibility and low initial costs, we urge data engineers to take an opex -first \\napproach centered on the cloud and flexible, pay-as-you-go technologies. \\nTotal Opportunity Cost of Ownership \\nAny choice inherently excludes other possibilities. Total opportunity cost of ownership \\n(TOCO) is the cost of lost opportunities that we incur in choosing a technology, an \\narchitecture, or a process. 48 Note that ownership in this setting doesn’t require long -\\nterm purchases of hardware or licenses. Even in a cloud environment, we effectively \\nown a technology, a stack, or a pipeline once it becomes a core part of our production \\n \\n48 For more details, see “Total Opportunity Cost of Ownership” by Joseph Reis in 97 Things Every Data \\nEngineer Should Know (O’Reilly). \\nCost Optimization and Business Value'),\n",

Data engineers often fail to evaluate \\nTOCO when undertaking a new project; in our opinion, this is a massive blind spot. \\nIf you choose data stack A, you’ve chosen the benefits of data stack A over all other \\noptions, effectively excluding data stacks B, C, and D. You’re committed to data stack \\nA and everything it entails—the team to support it, training, setup, and maintenanc e. \\nWhat happens if data stack A was a poor choice? What happens when data stack A \\nbecomes obsolete? Can you still move to other data stacks? \\nHow quickly and cheaply can you move to something newer and better? This is a \\ncritical question in the data space, where new technologies and products seem to appear \\nat an ever-faster rate. Does the expertise you’ve built up on data stack A translate to \\nthe next wave? Or are you able to swap out components of data stack A and buy \\nyourself some time and options? \\nThe first step to minimizing opportunity cost is evaluating it with eyes wide open. \\nWe’ve seen countless data teams get stuck with technologies that seemed good at the \\ntime and are either not flexible for future growth or simply obsolete. Inflexible data \\ntechnologies are a lot like bear traps. They’re easy to get into and extremely painful to \\nescape. \\nFinOps \\nWe already touched on FinOps in “Principle 9: Embrace FinOps” on page 85. As we’ve \\ndiscussed, typical cloud spending is inherently opex: companies pay for services to run \\ncritical data processes rather than making up-front purchases and clawing back value \\nover time. The goal of FinOps is to fully operationalize financial accou ntability and \\nbusiness value by applying the DevOps-like practices of monitoring and dynamically \\nadjusting systems. \\nIn this chapter, we want to emphasize one thing about FinOps that is well embodied in \\nthis quote:49 \\nIf it seems that FinOps is about saving money, then think again. FinOps is about \\nmaking money. Cloud spend can drive more revenue, signal customer base growth, \\nenable more product and feature release velocity, or even help shut down a data center. \\nIn our setting of data engineering, the ability to iterate quickly and scale dynamically \\nis invaluable for creating business value.

The intention to build \\na better future is noble but often leads to overarchitecting and overengineering. Tooling \\nchosen for the future may be stale and out-of-date when this future arrives; the future \\nfrequently looks little like what we envisioned years before. \\nAs many life coaches would tell you, focus on the present. You should choose the best \\ntechnology for the moment and near future, but in a way that supports future unknowns \\nand evolution. Ask yourself: where are you today, and what are your goals for the \\nfuture? Your answers to these questions should inform your decisions about your \\narchitecture and thus the technologies used within that architecture. This is done by \\nunderstanding what is likely to change and what tends to stay the same. \\nWe have two classes of tools to consider: immutable and transitory. Immutable \\ntechnologies might be components that underpin the cloud or languages and paradigms \\nthat have stood the test of time. In the cloud, examples of immutable technologies are \\nobject storage, networking, servers, and security. Object storage such as Amazon S3 \\nand Azure Blob Storage will be around from today until the end of the decade, and \\nprobably much longer. Storing your data in object storage is a wise choice. Object \\nstorage continues to improve in various ways and constantly offers new options, but \\nyour data will be safe and usable in object storage regardless of the rapid evolution of \\ntechnology as a whole. \\nFor languages, SQL and bash have been around for many decades, and we don’t see \\nthem disappearing anytime soon. Immutable technologies benefit from the Lindy \\neffect: the longer a technology has been established, the longer it will be used. Think \\nof the pow er grid, relational databases, the C programming language, or the x86 \\nprocessor architecture. We suggest applying the Lindy effect as a litmus test to \\ndetermine whether a technology is potentially immutable. \\nTransitory technologies are those that come and go. The typical trajectory begins with \\na lot of hype, followed by meteoric growth in popularity, then a slow descent into \\nobscurity. The JavaScript frontend landscape is a classic example. How many \\nJavaScript frontend frameworks ha ve come and gone between 2010 and 2020? \\nBackbone.js, Ember.js, and Knockout were popular in the early 2010s, and React and \\nVue.js have massive mindshare today.

A slow shift toward the cloud culminates in a veritable stampede of companies \\nspinning up workloads on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). In the last \\ndecade, many CTOs have come to view their decisions around technology hosting as \\nhaving existential significance for their organizations. If they move too slowly, they \\nrisk being left behind by their more agile competition; on the other hand, a poorly \\nplanned cloud migration could lead to technological failure and catastrophic costs. \\nLet’s look at the principal places to run your technology stack: on premises, the cloud, \\nhybrid cloud, and multicloud. \\nOn Premises \\nWhile new startups are increasingly born in the cloud, on-premises systems are still the \\ndefault for established companies. Essentially, these companies own their hardware, \\nwhich may live in data centers they own or in leased colocation space. In either ca se, \\ncompanies are operationally responsible for their hardware and the software that runs \\non it. If hardware fails, they have to repair or replace it. They also have to manage \\nupgrade cycles every few years as new, updated hardware is released and older \\nhardware ages and becomes less reliable. They must ensure that they have enough \\nhardware to handle peaks; for an online retailer, this means hosting enough capacity to \\nhandle the load spikes of Black Friday. For data engineers in charge of on -premises \\nsystems, this means buying large-enough systems to allow good performance for peak \\nload and large jobs without overbuying and overspending. \\nOn the one hand, established companies have established operational practices that \\nhave served them well. Suppose a company that relies on information technology has \\nbeen in business for some time. This means it has managed to juggle the cost and \\npersonnel requirements of running its hardware, managing software environments, \\ndeploying code from dev teams, and running databases and big data systems. \\nOn the other hand, established companies see their younger, more agile competition \\nscaling rapidly and taking advantage of cloud -managed services. They also see \\nestablished competitors making forays into the cloud, allowing them to temporarily \\nscale up eno rmous computing power for massive data jobs or the Black Friday \\nshopping spike.'),\n",

Every company \\nmust keep its existing systems running efficiently while deciding what moves to make \\nnext. This could involve adopting newer DevOps practices, such as containers, \\nKubernetes, microservices, and continuous deployment while keeping their hardware \\nrunning on premises. It could involve a complete migration to the cloud, as discussed \\nnext. \\nCloud \\nThe cloud flips the on-premises model on its head. Instead of purchasing hardware, you \\nsimply rent hardware and managed services from a cloud provider (such as AWS, \\nAzure, or Google Cloud). These resources can often be reserved on an extremely short-\\nterm basis; VMs spin up in less than a minute, and subsequent usage is billed in per -\\nsecond increments. This allows cloud users to dynamically scale resources that were \\ninconceivable with on-premises servers. \\nIn a cloud environment, engineers can quickly launch projects and experiment without \\nworrying about long lead time hardware planning. They can begin running servers as \\nsoon as their code is ready to deploy. This makes the cloud model extremely appealing \\nto startups that are tight on budget and time. \\nThe early cloud era was dominated by infrastructure as a service (IaaS) offerings — \\nproducts such as VMs and virtual disks that are essentially rented slices of hardware. \\nSlowly, we’ve seen a shift toward platform as a service (PaaS), while SaaS products \\ncontinue to grow at a rapid clip. \\nPaaS includes IaaS products but adds more sophisticated managed services to support \\napplications. Examples are managed databases such as Amazon Relational Database \\nService (RDS) and Google Cloud SQL, managed streaming platforms such as Amazon \\nKinesis and S imple Queue Service (SQS), and managed Kubernetes such as Google \\nKubernetes Engine (GKE) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). PaaS services allow \\nengineers to ignore the operational details of managing individual machines and \\ndeploying frameworks across dis tributed systems. They provide turnkey access to \\ncomplex, autoscaling systems with minimal operational overhead. \\nSaaS offerings move one additional step up the ladder of abstraction. SaaS typically \\nprovides a fully functioning enterprise software platform with little operational \\nmanagement. Examples of SaaS include Salesforce, Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, \\nZoom, a nd Fivetran. Both the major public clouds and third parties offer SaaS \\nplatforms.

Many people quibble with \\nthe term serverless; after all, the code must run somewhere. In practice, serverless \\nusually means many invisible servers. \\nCloud services have become increasingly appealing to established businesses with \\nexisting data centers and IT infrastructure. Dynamic, seamless scaling is extremely \\nvaluable to businesses that deal with seasonality (e.g., retail businesses coping with \\nBlack Friday load) and web traffic load spikes. The advent of COVID-19 in 2020 was \\na major driver of cloud adoption, as companies recognized the value of rapidly scaling \\nup data processes to gain insights in a highly uncertain business climate; businesses \\nalso had to cope with substantially increased load due to a spike in online shopping, \\nweb app usage, and remote work. \\nBefore we discuss the nuances of choosing technologies in the cloud, let’s first discuss \\nwhy migration to the cloud requires a dramatic shift in thinking, specifically on the \\npricing front; this is closely related to FinOps, introduced in “FinOps” on page 120 . \\nEnterprises that migrate to the cloud often make major deployment errors by not \\nappropriately adapting their practices to the cloud pricing model. \\nA Brief Detour on Cloud Economics \\nTo understand how to use cloud services efficiently through cloud native architecture , \\nyou need to know how clouds make money. This is an extremely complex concept and \\none on which cloud providers offer little transparency. Consider this sidebar a starting \\npoint for your research, discovery, and process development. \\nCloud Services and Credit Default Swaps \\nLet’s go on a little tangent about credit default swaps. Don’t worry, this will make sense \\nin a bit. Recall that credit default swaps rose to infamy after the 2007 global financial \\ncrisis. A credit default swap was a mechanism for selling different tiers of risk attached \\nto an asset (e.g., a mortgage). It is not our intention to present this idea in any detail, but \\nrather to offer an analogy wherein many cloud services are similar to financial \\nderivatives; cloud providers not only slice hardware assets into  small pieces through \\nvirtualization, but also sell these pieces with varying technical characteristics and risks \\nattached. While providers are extremely tight -lipped about details of their internal \\nsystems, there are massive opportunities for optimization  and scaling by understanding \\ncloud pricing and exchanging notes with other users.'),\n",

How is this possible? \\nHere’s our educated guess. When purchasing cloud storage, each disk in a storage \\ncluster has three assets that cloud providers and consumers use. First, it has a certain \\nstorage capacity —say, 10 TB. Second, it supports a certain number of input/output \\noperations (IOPs) per second —say, 100. Third, disks support a certain maximum \\nbandwidth, the maximum read speed for optimally organized files. A magnetic drive \\nmight be capable of reading at 200 MB/s. \\nAny of these limits (IOPs, storage capacity, bandwidth) is a potential bottleneck for a \\ncloud provider. For instance, the cloud provider might have a disk storing 3 TB of data \\nbut hitting maximum IOPs. An alternative to leaving the remaining 7 TB empty is to \\nsell the empty space without selling IOPs. Or, more specifically, sell cheap storage \\nspace and expensive IOPs to discourage reads. \\nMuch like traders of financial derivatives, cloud vendors also deal in risk. In the case \\nof archival storage, vendors are selling a type of insurance, but one that pays out for \\nthe insurer rather than the policy buyer in the event of a catastrophe. While data storage \\ncosts per month are extremely cheap, I risk paying a high price if I ever need to retrieve \\ndata. But this is a price that I will happily pay in a true emergency. \\nSimilar considerations apply to nearly any cloud service. While on -premises servers \\nare essentially sold as commodity hardware, the cost model in the cloud is more subtle. \\nRather than just charging for CPU cores, memory, and features, cloud vendors \\nmonetize characteristics such as durability, reliability, longevity, and predictability; a \\nvariety of compute platforms discount their offerings for workloads that are ephemeral \\nor can be arbitrarily interrupted when capacity is needed elsewhere. \\nCloud ≠ On Premises \\nThis heading may seem like a silly tautology, but the belief that cloud services are just \\nlike familiar on -premises servers is a widespread cognitive error that plagues cloud \\nmigrations and leads to horrifying bills. This demonstrates a broader issue in te ch that \\nwe refer to as the curse of familiarity. Many new technology products are intentionally \\ndesigned to look like something familiar to facilitate ease of use and accelerate \\nadoption. But, any new technology product has subtleties and wrinkles that users must \\nlearn to identify, accommodate, and optimize. \\nMoving on-premises servers one by one to VMs in the cloud—known as simple lift and \\nshift—is a perfectly reasonable strategy for the initial phase of cloud migration, \\nespecially when a company is facing some kind of financial cliff, such as the need to \\nsign a significant new lease or hardware contract if existing hardware is not shut down. \\nHowever, companies that leave their cloud assets in this initial state are in for a rude \\nshock. On a direct comparison basis, long-running servers in the cloud are significantly \\nmore expensive than their on-premises counterparts.'),\n",

Rather than deploying a set of long -running servers capable of handling full \\npeak load, use autoscaling to allow workloads to scale down to minimal infrastructure \\nwhen loads are light and up to massive clusters during peak times. To realize discounts \\nthrough more ephemeral, less durable workloads, use reserved or spot instances, or use \\nserverless functions in place of servers. \\nWe often think of this optimization as leading to lower costs, but we should also strive \\nto increase business value  by exploiting the dynamic nature of the cloud. 50 Data \\nengineers can create new value in the cloud by accomplishing things that were \\nimpossible in their on -premises environment. For example, it is possible to quickly \\nspin up massive compute clusters to run complex transformations at scales that were \\nunaffordable for on-premises hardware. \\nData Gravity \\nIn addition to basic errors such as following on -premises operational practices in the \\ncloud, data engineers need to watch out for other aspects of cloud pricing and \\nincentives that frequently catch users unawares. \\nVendors want to lock you into their offerings.

Virtually no business can migrate all of its workloads overnight. \\nThe hybrid cloud model assumes that an organization will indefinitely maintain some \\nworkloads outside the cloud. \\nThere are many reasons to consider a hybrid cloud model. Organizations may believe \\nthat they have achieved operational excellence in certain areas, such as their application \\nstack and associated hardware. Thus, they may migrate only to specific workloads \\nwhere they see immediate benefits in the cloud environment. For example, an on -\\npremises Spark stack is migrated to ephemeral cloud clusters, reducing the operational \\nburden of managing software and hardware for the data engineering team and allowing \\nrapid scaling for large data jobs. \\n \\n50 This is a major point of emphasis in Storment and Fuller, Cloud FinOps.'),\n",

Dropbox’s core \\ncompetence is a differential file-update system that can efficiently synchronize actively \\nedited files among users while minimizing network and CPU usage. The product is not \\na good fit for object storage, block storage, or other standard cloud offerings. Dropbox \\nhas instead benefited from building a custom, highly integrated software and hardware \\nstack.53 \\nFourth, while Dropbox moved its core product to its hardware, it continued building \\nout other AWS workloads. This allows Dropbox to focus on building one highly tuned \\ncloud service at an extraordinary scale rather than trying to replace multiple services. \\nDropbox can focus on its core competence in cloud storage and data synchronization \\nwhile offloading software and hardware management in other areas, such as data \\nanalytics.54 \\nOther frequently cited success stories that companies have built outside the cloud \\ninclude Backblaze and Cloudflare, but these offer similar lessons.

Monolithic systems are self -contained, often performing multiple \\nfunctions under a single system. The monolith camp favors the simplicity of having \\neverything in one place. It’s easier to reason about a single entity, and you can move \\nfaster because there are fewer moving parts.

Let’s explore the trade-\\noffs. \\nMonolith \\nThe monolith (Figure 4-4) has been a technology mainstay for decades. The old days \\nof waterfall meant that software releases were huge, tightly coupled, and moved at a \\nslow cadence. Large teams worked together to deliver a single working codebase. \\nMonolithic data systems continue  to this day, with older software vendors such as \\nInformatica and open source frameworks such as Spark. \\nThe pros of the monolith are it’s easy to reason about, and it requires a lower cognitive \\nburden and context switching since everything is self-contained.

The monolith tightly couples its services \\nOf course, the monolith has cons. For one thing, monoliths are brittle. Because of the \\nvast number of moving parts, updates and releases take longer and tend to bake in “the \\nkitchen sink.” If the system has a bug—hopefully, the software’s been thoroughly tested \\nbefore release!—it can harm the entire system. \\nUser-induced problems also happen with monoliths. For example, we saw a monolithic \\nETL pipeline that took 48 hours to run. If anything broke anywhere in the pipeline, the \\nentire process had to restart. Meanwhile, anxious business users were waiting for their \\nreports, which were already two days late by default and usually arrived much later. \\nBreakages were common enough that the monolithic system was eventually thrown \\nout. \\nMultitenancy in a monolithic system can also be a significant problem. It can be \\nchallenging to isolate the workloads of multiple users. In an on-prem data warehouse, \\none user-defined function might consume enough CPU to slow the system for other \\nusers. Conflicts between dependencies and resource contention are frequent sources of \\nheadaches. \\nAnother con of monoliths is that switching to a new system will be painful if the vendor \\nor open source project dies. Because all of your processes are contained in the monolith, \\nextracting yourself out of that system, and onto a new platform, will be cost ly in both \\ntime and money. \\nModularity \\nModularity (Figure 4 -5) is an old concept in software engineering, but modular \\ndistributed systems truly came into vogue with the rise of microservices. Instead of \\nrelying on a massive monolith to handle your needs, why not break apart systems and \\nprocesses into their self-contained areas of concern? Microservices can communicate \\nvia APIs, allowing developers to focus on their domains while making their \\napplications accessible to other microservices.

With modularity, each service is decoupled from another \\nMajor tech companies have been key drivers in the microservices movement.

Bezos also imposed the two-pizza rule (no team should \\nbe so large that two pizzas can’t feed the whole group). Effectively, this means that a \\nteam will have at most five members. This cap also limits the complexity of a team’s \\ndomain of responsibility—in particular, the codebase that it can manage. Whereas an \\nextensive monolithic application might entail a group of one hundred people, dividing \\ndevelopers into small groups of five requires that this application be broken into small, \\nmanageable, loosely coupled pieces. \\nIn a modular microservice environment, components are swappable, and it’s possible \\nto create a polyglot (multiprogramming language) application; a Java service can \\nreplace a service written in Python. Service customers need worry only about the \\ntechnical specifications of the service API, not behind-the-scenes details of \\nimplementation. \\nData-processing technologies have shifted toward a modular model by providing strong \\nsupport for interoperability. Data is stored in object storage in a standard format such \\nas Parquet in data lakes and lakehouses.

Orchestration becomes the \\nglue that binds data stack modules together. \\nThe Distributed Monolith Pattern \\nThe distributed monolith pattern is a distributed architecture that still suffers from many \\nof the limitations of monolithic architecture. The basic idea is that one runs a distributed \\nsystem with different services to perform different tasks. Still, services and nodes share \\na common set of dependencies or a common codebase. \\nOne standard example is a traditional Hadoop cluster. A Hadoop cluster can \\nsimultaneously host several frameworks, such as Hive, Pig, or Spark. The cluster also \\nhas many internal dependencies. In addition, the cluster runs core Hadoop components: \\nHadoop common libraries, HDFS, Y ARN, and Java. In practice, a cluster often has one \\nversion of each component installed. \\nA standard on -prem Hadoop system entails managing a common environment that \\nworks for all users and all jobs. Managing upgrades and installations is a significant \\nchallenge. Forcing jobs to upgrade dependencies risks breaking them; maintaining two \\nversions of a framework entails extra complexity. \\nSome modern Python -based orchestration technologies —e.g., Apache Airflow—also \\nsuffer from this problem. While they utilize a highly decoupled and asynchronous \\narchitecture, every service runs the same codebase with the same dependencies. Any \\nexecutor can execute any task, so a client library for a single task run in one DAG must \\nbe installed on the whole cluster. Orchestrating many tools entails installing client \\nlibraries for a host of APIs. Dependency conflicts are a constant problem. \\nOne solution to the problems of the distributed monolith is ephemeral infrastructure in \\na cloud setting. Each job gets its own temporary server or cluster installed with \\ndependencies. Each cluster remains highly monolithic, but separating jobs dramatically \\nreduces conflicts. For example, this pattern is now quite common for Spark with \\nservices like Amazon EMR and Google Cloud Dataproc. \\nA second solution is to properly decompose the distributed monolith into multiple \\nsoftware environments using containers. We have more to say on containers in \\n“Serverless Versus Servers” on page 143. \\nOur Advice \\nWhile monoliths are attractive because of ease of understanding and reduced \\ncomplexity, this comes at a high cost.

For other cases, it might not be a good fit. \\nLet’s look at how to evaluate whether serverless is right for you. \\nServerless \\nThough serverless has been around for quite some time, the serverless trend kicked off \\nin full force with AWS Lambda in 2014. With the promise of executing small chunks \\nof code on an as-needed basis without having to manage a server, serverless exploded \\nin popularity. The main reasons for its popularity are cost and convenience. Instead of \\npaying the cost of a server, why not just pay when your code is evoked? \\nServerless has many flavors. Though function as a service (FaaS) is wildly popular, \\nserverless systems predate the advent of AWS Lambda. For example, Google Cloud’s \\nBigQuery is serverless in that data engineers don’t need to manage backend \\ninfrastructure, and the system scales to zero and scales up automatically to handle large \\nqueries. Just load data into the system and start querying. You pay for the amount of \\ndata your query consumes and a small cost to store your data. This payment model —\\npaying for cons umption and storage —is becoming more prevalent. When does \\nserverless make sense? As with many other cloud services, it depends; and data \\nengineers would do well to understand the details of cloud pricing to predict when \\nserverless deployments will become e xpensive.

Containers play a role in \\nboth serverless and microservices. \\nContainers are often referred to as lightweight virtual machines. Whereas a traditional \\nVM wraps up an entire operating system, a container packages an isolated user space \\n(such as a filesystem and a few processes); many such containers can coexist on a single \\nhost operating system. This provides some of the principal benefits of virtualization \\n(i.e., dependency and code isolation) without the overhead of carrying around an entire \\noperating system kernel. \\nA single hardware node can host numerous containers with fine -grained resource \\nallocations. At the time of this writing, containers continue to grow in popularity, along \\nwith Kubernetes, a container management system. Serverless environments typically \\nrun on containers behind the scenes. Indeed, Kubernetes is a kind of serverless \\nenvironment because it allows developers and ops teams to deploy microservices \\nwithout worrying about the details of the machines where they are deployed. Containers \\nprovide a partial solution to problems of the distributed monolith mentioned earlier in \\nthis chapter. For example, Hadoop now supports containers, allowing each job to have \\nits own isolated dependencies. \\nContainer clusters do not provide the same security and isolation \\nthat full VMs offer. Container escape—broadly, a class of exploits \\nwhereby code in a container gains privileges outside the container \\nat the OS level —is common enough to be considered a risk for \\nmultitenancy. While Amazon EC2 is a truly multitenant \\nenvironment with VMs from many customers hosted on the same hardware, a \\nKubernetes cluster should host code only within an environment of mutual trust \\n(e.g., inside the walls of a single company). In addition, code review processes \\nand vulnerability scanning are critical to ensure that a developer doesn’t introduce \\na security hole. \\nVarious flavors of container platforms add additional serverless features.

Cost is a big factor. Serverless makes less sense when the usage and cost \\nexceed the ongoing cost of running and maintaining a server (Figure 4-6). However, at \\na certain scale, the economic benefits of serverless may diminish, and running servers \\nbecomes more attractive. \\n \\nFigure 4-6. Cost of serverless versus utilizing a server \\nCustomization, power, and control are other major reasons to favor servers over \\nserverless. Some serverless frameworks can be underpowered or limited for certain use \\ncases. Here are some things to consider when using servers, particularly in the cloud, \\nwhere server resources are ephemeral: \\nExpect servers to fail. \\nServer failure will happen. Avoid using a “special snowflake” server that is overly \\ncustomized and brittle, as this introduces a glaring vulnerability in your \\narchitecture.

Let’s briefly review them again. \\nData Management \\nData management is a broad area, and concerning technologies, it isn’t always apparent \\nwhether a technology adopts data management as a principal concern. For example, \\nbehind the scenes, a third -party vendor may use data management best practices —\\nregulatory compliance, security, privacy, data quality, and governance— but hide these \\ndetails behind a limited UI layer. In this case, while evaluating the product, it helps to \\nask the company about its data management practices. Here are some sample questions \\nyou should ask: \\n• How are you protecting data against breaches, both from the outside and within? \\n• What is your product’s compliance with GDPR, CCPA, and other data privacy \\nregulations? \\n• Do you allow me to host my data to comply with these regulations? \\n• How do you ensure data quality and that I’m viewing the correct data in your \\nsolution?'),\n",

These same \\nquestions should also apply to the OSS solutions you’re considering. \\nDataOps \\nProblems will happen. They just will. A server or database may die, a cloud’s region \\nmay have an outage, you might deploy buggy code, bad data might be introduced into \\nyour data warehouse, and other unforeseen problems may occur. \\nUndercurrents and Their Impacts on Choosing Technologies  \\nWhen evaluating a new technology, how much control do you have over deploying new \\ncode, how will you be alerted if there’s a problem, and how will you respond when \\nthere’s a problem? The answer largely depends on the type of technology you’re \\nconsidering. If the technology is OSS, you’re likely responsible for setting up \\nmonitoring, hosting, and code deployment. How will you handle issues? What’s your \\nincident response? \\nMuch of the operations are outside your control if you’re using a managed offering. \\nConsider the vendor’s SLA, the way they alert you to issues, and whether they’re \\ntransparent about how they’re addressing the case, including providing an ETA to a fix. \\nData Architecture \\nAs discussed in Chapter 3 , good data architecture means assessing trade -offs and \\nchoosing the best tools for the job while keeping your decisions reversible. With the \\ndata landscape morphing at warp speed, the best tool for the job is a moving target. The \\nmain goals are to avoid unnecessary lock -in, ensure interoperability across the data \\nstack, and produce high ROI. Choose your technologies accordingly. \\nOrchestration Example: Airflow \\nThroughout most of this chapter, we have actively avoided discussing any particular \\ntechnology too extensively. We make an exception for orchestration because the space \\nis currently dominated by one open source technology, Apache Airflow. \\nMaxime Beauchemin kicked off the Airflow project at Airbnb in 2014. Airflow was \\ndeveloped from the beginning as a noncommercial open source project. The framework \\nquickly grew significant mindshare outside Airbnb, becoming an Apache Incubator \\nproject in 2016 and a full Apache-sponsored project in 2019. \\nAirflow enjoys many advantages, largely because of its dominant position in the open \\nsource marketplace.

Third, Airflow is available \\ncommercially as a managed service or software distribution through many vendors, \\nincluding GCP, AWS, and Astronomer.io. \\nAirflow also has some downsides. Airflow relies on a few core nonscalable components \\n(the scheduler and backend database) that can become bottlenecks for performance, \\nscale, and reliability; the scalable parts of Airflow still follow a distributed monolith  \\npattern. (See “Monolith Versus Modular” on page 139.) Finally, Airflow lacks support \\nfor many data-native constructs, such as schema management, lineage, and cataloging; \\nand it is challenging to develop and test Airflow workflows. \\nWe do not attempt an exhaustive discussion of Airflow alternatives here but just \\nmention a couple of the key orchestration contenders at the time of writing.

Will there be other orchestration frameworks \\nand technologies not discussed here? Plan on it. \\nWe highly recommend that anyone choosing an orchestration technology study the \\noptions discussed here. They should also acquaint themselves with activity in the space, \\nas new developments will certainly occur by the time you read this. \\nSoftware Engineering \\nAs a data engineer, you should strive for simplification and abstraction across the data \\nstack. Buy or use prebuilt open source solutions whenever possible. Eliminating \\nundifferentiated heavy lifting should be your big goal.

Data is an unorganized, \\ncontext-less collection of facts and figures. It can be created in many ways, both analog \\nand digital. \\nAnalog data creation occurs in the real world, such as vocal speech, sign language, \\nwriting on paper, or playing an instrument. This analog data is often transient; how \\noften have you had a verbal conversation whose contents are lost to the ether after the \\nconversation ends? \\nDigital data is either created by converting analog data to digital form or is the native \\nproduct of a digital system. An example of analog to digital is a mobile texting app that \\nconverts analog speech into digital text. An example of digital data creation is a credit \\ncard transaction on an ecommerce platform. A customer places an order, the transaction \\nis charged to their credit card, and the information for the transaction is saved to \\nvarious databases.'),\n",

But in truth, data is everywhere in the \\nworld around us. We capture data from IoT devices, credit card terminals, telescope \\nsensors, stock trades, and more. \\nGet familiar with your source system and how it generates data. Put in the effort to \\nread the source system documentation and understand its patterns and quirks. If your \\nsource system is an RDBMS, learn how it operates (writes, commits, queries, etc.); \\nlearn the ins and outs of the source system that might affect your ability to ingest from \\nit. \\nSource Systems: Main Ideas \\nSource systems produce data in various ways. This section discusses the main ideas \\nyou’ll frequently encounter as you work with source systems. \\nFiles and Unstructured Data \\nA file is a sequence of bytes, typically stored on a disk. Applications often write data \\nto files. Files may store local parameters, events, logs, images, and audio. \\nIn addition, files are a universal medium of data exchange. As much as data engineers \\nwish that they could get data programmatically, much of the world still sends and \\nreceives files. For example, if you’re getting data from a government agency, there’s \\nan excellent chance you’ll download the data as an Excel or CSV file or receive the \\nfile in an email. \\nThe main types of source file formats you’ll run into as a data engineer —files that \\noriginate either manually or as an output from a source system process —are Excel, \\nCSV , TXT, JSON, and XML. These files have their quirks and can be structured (Excel, \\nCSV), semistructured (JSON, XML, CSV), or unstructured (TXT, CSV). Although \\nyou’ll use certain formats heavily as a data engineer (such as Parquet, ORC, and Avro), \\nwe’ll cover these later and put the spotlight here on source system files. Chapter 6 \\ncovers the technical details of files. \\nAPIs \\nApplication programming interfaces  (APIs) are a standard way of exchanging data \\nbetween systems. In theory, APIs simplify the data ingestion task for data engineers. \\nIn practice, many APIs still expose a good deal of data complexity for engineers to \\nmanage. Even with the rise of various se rvices and frameworks, and services for \\nautomating API data ingestion, data engineers must often invest a good deal of energy'),\n",

We discuss APIs in greater detail later in \\nthis chapter. \\nApplication Databases (OLTP Systems) \\nAn application database stores the state of an application. A standard example is a \\ndatabase that stores account balances for bank accounts. As customer transactions and \\npayments happen, the application updates bank account balances. \\nTypically, an application database is an online transaction processing  (OLTP) \\nsystem— a database that reads and writes individual data records at a high rate. OLTP \\nsystems are often referred to as transactional databases, but this does not necessarily \\nimply that the system in question supports atomic transactions. \\nMore generally, OLTP databases support low latency and high concurrency. An \\nRDBMS database can select or update a row in less than a millisecond (not accounting \\nfor network latency) and handle thousands of reads and writes per second. A document \\ndatabase cluster can manage even higher document commit rates at the expense of \\npotential inconsistency. Some graph databases can also handle transactional use cases. \\nFundamentally, OLTP databases work well as application backends when thousands or \\neven millions of users might be interacting with the application simultaneously, \\nupdating and writing data concurrently. OLTP systems are less suited to use cases \\ndriven by analytics at scale, where a single query must scan a vast amount of data. \\nACID \\nSupport for atomic transactions is one of a critical set of database characteristics known \\ntogether as ACID (as you may recall from Chapter 3 , this stands for atomicity, \\nconsistency, isolation, durability ). Consistency means that any database read will \\nreturn the last written version of the retrieved item. Isolation entails that if two updates \\nare in flight concurrently for the same thing, the end database state will be consistent \\nwith the sequential execution of these updates in the order they were submitt ed. \\nDurability indicates that committed data will never be lost, even in the event of power \\nloss. \\nNote that ACID characteristics are not required to support application backends, and \\nrelaxing these constraints can be a considerable boon to performance and scale. \\nHowever, ACID characteristics guarantee that the database will maintain a consistent \\npicture of the world, dramatically simplifying the app developer’s task. \\nAll engineers (data or otherwise) must understand operating with and without ACID. \\nFor instance, to improve performance, some distributed databases use relaxed \\nconsistency constraints, such as eventual consistency, to improve performance.'),\n",

Money is then moved from \\nAccount A to Account B if sufficient funds  are in Account A. The entire transaction \\nshould run with updates to both account balances or fail without updating either \\naccount balance. That is, the whole operation should happen as a transaction. \\n \\nFigure 5-2. Example of an atomic transaction: a bank account transfer using OLTP \\nOLTP and analytics \\nOften, small companies run analytics directly on an OLTP. This pattern works in the \\nshort term but is ultimately not scalable. At some point, running analytical queries on \\nOLTP runs into performance issues due to structural limitations of OLTP or resource \\ncontention with competing transactional workloads. Data engineers must understand \\nthe inner workings of OLTP and application backends to set up appropriate integrations \\nwith analytics systems without degrading production application performance. \\nAs companies offer more analytics capabilities in SaaS applications, the need for \\nhybrid capabilities—quick updates with combined analytics capabilities—has created \\nnew challenges for data engineers. We’ll use the term data application to refer to \\napplications that hybridize transactional and analytics workloads. \\nOnline Analytical Processing System \\nIn contrast to an OLTP system, an online analytical processing (OLAP) system is built \\nto run large analytics queries and is typically inefficient at handling lookups of \\nindividual records. For example, modern column databases are optimized to scan large \\nvolumes of data, dispensing with indexes to improve scalability and scan performance. \\nAny query typically involves scanning a minimal data block, often 100 MB or more in \\nsize.

The online part of OLAP \\nimplies that the system constantly listens for incoming queries, making OLAP systems \\nsuitable for interactive analytics. \\nAlthough this chapter covers source systems, OLAPs are typically storage and query \\nsystems for analytics. Why are we talking about them in our chapter on source \\nsystems? In practical use cases, engineers often need to read data from an OLAP \\nsystem.

Relational \\ndatabases often generate an event log stored directly on the database server that can be \\nprocessed to create a stream. (See “Database Logs” on page 161.) Many cloud NoSQL \\ndatabases can send a log or event stream to a target storage location. \\nLogs \\nA log captures information about events that occur in systems. For example, a log may \\ncapture traffic and usage patterns on a web server. Your desktop computer’s operating \\nsystem (Windows, macOS, Linux) logs events as the system boots and when \\napplications start or crash, for example. \\nLogs are a rich data source, potentially valuable for downstream data analysis, ML, \\nand automation.

CRUD guarantees these four operations will occur on data, regardless of its \\nstorage. \\nCRUD is a widely used pattern in software applications, and you’ll commonly find \\nCRUD used in APIs and databases. For example, a web application will make heavy \\nuse of CRUD for RESTful HTTP requests and storing and retrieving data from a \\ndatabase. \\nAs with any database, we can use snapshot-based extraction to get data from a database \\nwhere our application applies CRUD operations. On the other hand, event extraction \\nwith CDC gives us a complete history of operations and potentially allows for near \\nreal-time analytics. \\nInsert-Only \\nThe insert-only pattern retains history directly in a table containing data. Rather than \\nupdating records, new records get inserted with a timestamp indicating when they were \\ncreated (Table 5-1). For example, suppose you have a table of customer addresses. \\nFollowing a CRUD pattern, you would simply update the record if the customer \\nchanged their address. With the insert -only pattern, a new address record is inserted \\nwith the same customer ID.

For \\nexample, we have System 1 and System 2, where System 1 sends a message to System \\n2. These systems could be different microservices, a server sending a message to a \\nserverless function, etc. A message is typically sent through a message queue from a \\npublisher to a consumer, and once the message is delivered, it is removed from the \\nqueue. \\n \\nFigure 5-4.

For example, an \\nIoT device might send a message with the latest temperature reading to a message \\nqueue.

This service sends a message to a furnace controller that \\ntakes the appropriate action. Once the message is received, and the action is taken, the \\nmessage is removed from the message queue. \\nBy contrast, a stream is an append-only log of event records. (Streams are ingested and \\nstored in event-streaming platforms, which we discuss at greater length in “Messages \\nand Streams” on page 163 .) As events occur, they are accumulated in an ordered \\nsequence (Figure 5-5); a timestamp or an ID might order events.

Relational databases were developed at IBM in the 1970s and \\npopularized by Oracle in the 1980s. The growth of the internet saw the rise of the \\nLAMP stack (Linux, Apache web server, MySQL, PHP) and an  explosion of vendor \\nand open source RDBMS options. Even with the rise of NoSQL databases (described \\nin the following section), relational databases have remained extremely popular. \\nData is stored in a table of relations (rows), and each relation contains multiple fields \\n(columns); see Figure 5-7.

In particular, it is possible to design a \\nnormalized schema. Normalization is a strategy for ensuring that data in records is not \\nduplicated in multiple places, thus avoiding the need to update states in multiple \\nlocations at once and preventing inconsistencies (see Chapter 8). \\nRDBMS systems are typically ACID compliant.

But as always in architecture, trade -offs exist. NoSQL \\ndatabases also typically abandon various RDBMS characteristics, such as strong \\nconsistency, joins, or a fixed schema. \\nA big theme of this book is that data innovation is constant. Let’s take a quick look at \\nthe history of NoSQL, as it’s helpful to gain a perspective on why and how data \\ninnovations impact your work as a data engineer. In the early 2000s, tech companies \\nsuch as Google and Amazon began to outgrow their relational databases and pioneered \\nnew distributed, nonrelational databases to scale their web platforms. \\nWhile the term NoSQL first appeared in 1998, the modern version was coined by Eric \\nEvans in the 2000s.62 He tells the story in a 2009 blog post: \\nI’ve spent the last couple of days at nosqleast and one of the hot topics here is the name \\n“nosql.” Understandably, there are a lot of people who worry that the name is Bad, \\nthat it sends an inappropriate or inaccurate message. While I make no claims to the \\nidea, I do have to accept some blame for what it is now being called. How’s that?

Because there are far too many NoSQL databases to cover exhaustively in \\nthis section, we consider the following database types: key -value, document, wide -\\ncolumn, graph, search, and time series. These databases are all wildly popular and \\nenjoy widespread adoption. A data engineer should understand these types of \\ndatabases, including usage considerations, the structure of the data they store, and how \\nto leverage each in the data engineering lifecycle. \\nKey-value stores.    A key-value database is a nonrelational database that retrieves \\nrecords using a key that uniquely identifies each record. This is similar to hash map or \\ndictionary data structures presented in many programming languages but potentially \\nmore scalable. Key -value stores encompas s several NoSQL database types —for \\nexample, document stores and wide column databases (discussed next). Different types \\nof key-value databases offer a variety of performance characteristics to serve various \\napplication needs. For example, in -memory key -value databases are popular for \\ncaching session data for web and mobile applications, where ultra-fast lookup and high \\nconcurrency are required. Storage in these systems is typically temporary; if the \\ndatabase shuts down, the data disappears. Such caches can reduce pressure on the main \\napplication database and serve speedy responses. \\nOf course, key -value stores can also serve applications requiring high -durability \\npersistence. An ecommerce application may need to save and update massive amounts \\nof event state changes for a user and their orders. A user logs into the ecommerce \\napplication, clicks around various screens, adds items to a shopping cart, and then \\nchecks out. Each event must be durably stored for retrieval. Key -value stores often \\npersist data to disk and across multiple nodes to support such use cases. \\nDocument stores.    As mentioned previously, a document store is a specialized key-\\nvalue store. In this context, a document is a nested object; we can usually think of each \\ndocument as a JSON object for practical purposes. Documents are stored in collections \\nand retrieved by key. A collection is roughly equivalent to a table in a relational \\ndatabase (see Table 5-2). \\nTable 5-2.

This means that data cannot be easily normalized, i.e., split \\nacross multiple tables. (Applications can still join manually. Code can look up a \\ndocument, extract a property, and then retrieve another document.) Ideally, all related \\ndata can be stored in the same document. \\nIn many cases, the same data must be stored in multiple documents spread across \\nnumerous collections; software engineers must be careful to update a property \\neverywhere it is stored. (Many document stores support a notion of transactions to \\nfacilitate this.) \\nDocument databases generally embrace all the flexibility of JSON and don’t enforce \\nschema or types; this is a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, this allows the schema \\nto be highly flexible and expressive. The schema can also evolve as an application \\ngrows.

Technical expertise in a particular \\ndocument store is essential to understanding performance, tuning, configuration,  \\nrelated effects on writes, consistency, durability, etc. For example, many document \\nstores are eventually consistent. Allowing data distribution across a cluster is a boon \\nfor scaling and performance but can lead to catastrophes when engineers and \\ndevelopers don’t understand the implications.63 \\nTo run analytics on document stores, engineers generally must run a full scan to extract \\nall data from a collection or employ a CDC strategy to send events to a target stream. \\nThe full scan approach can have both performance and cost implications. The scan  \\noften slows the database as it runs, and many serverless cloud offerings charge a \\nsignificant fee for each full scan. In document databases, it’s often helpful to create an \\nindex to help speed up queries. We discuss indexes and query patterns in Chapter 8. \\nWide-column.    A wide-column database is optimized for storing massive amounts \\nof data with high transaction rates and extremely low latency. These databases can \\nscale to extremely high write rates and vast amounts of data. Specifically, widecolumn \\ndatabases can support petabytes of data, millions of requests per second, and sub-10ms \\nlatency. These characteristics have made wide -column databases popular in \\necommerce, fintech, ad tech, IoT, and real -time personalization applications. Data \\nengineers must be aware of the operational characteristics of the wide -column \\ndatabases they work with to set up a suitable configuration, design the schema, and \\nchoose an appropriate row key to optimize performance and avoid common \\noperational issues. \\nThese databases support rapid scans of massive amounts of data, but they do not \\nsupport complex queries. They have only a single index (the row key) for lookups. \\n \\n63 Nemil Dalal’s excellent series on the history of MongoDB recounts some harrowing tales of database abuse \\nand its consequences for fledgling startups.'),\n",

This can be accomplished by \\nrunning large scans for the extraction or employing CDC to capture an event stream. \\nGraph databases.    Graph databases explicitly store data with a mathematical graph \\nstructure (as a set of nodes and edges). 64 Neo4j has proven extremely popular, while \\nAmazon, Oracle, and other vendors offer their graph database products. Roughly \\nspeaking, graph databases are a good fit when you want to analyze the connectivity \\nbetween elements. \\nFor example, you could use a document database to store one document for each user \\ndescribing their properties. You could add an array element for connections that \\ncontains directly connected users’ IDs in a social media context. It’s pretty easy to \\ndetermine the number of direct connections a user has, but suppose you want to know \\nhow many users can be reached by traversing two direct connections. You could \\nanswer this question by writing complex code, but each query would run slowly and \\nconsume significant resources. The document store is simply not optimized for this use \\ncase. \\nGraph databases are designed for precisely this type of query. Their data structures \\nallow for queries based on the connectivity between elements; graph databases are \\nindicated when we care about understanding complex traversals between elements. In \\nthe parlance of graphs, we store nodes (users in the preceding example) and edges \\n(connections between users). Graph databases support rich data models for both nodes \\nand edges. Depending on the underlying graph database engine, graph databases utilize \\nspecialized query languages such as SPARQL, Resource Description Framework \\n(RDF), Graph Query Language (GQL), and Cypher. \\nAs an example of a graph, consider a network of four users. User 1 follows User 2, \\nwho follows User 3 and User 4; User 3 also follows User 4 (Figure 5-8). \\n \\nFigure 5-8.

Graph structures are also fascinating from \\nthe perspective of data science and ML, potentially revealing deep insights into human \\ninteractions and behavior. \\nThis introduces unique challenges for data engineers who may be more accustomed to \\ndealing with structured relations, documents, or unstructured data. Engineers must \\nchoose whether to do the following: \\n• Map source system graph data into one of their existing preferred paradigms \\n• Analyze graph data within the source system itself \\n• Adopt graph-specific analytics tools \\nGraph data can be reencoded into rows in a relational database, which may be a suitable \\nsolution depending on the analytics use case.

A search database is a nonrelational database used to search your data’s \\ncomplex and straightforward semantic and structural characteristics. Two prominent \\nuse cases exist for a search database: text search and log analysis. Let’s cover each of \\nthese separately. \\nText search involves searching a body of text for keywords or phrases, matching on \\nexact, fuzzy, or semantically similar matches. Log analysis  is typically used for \\nanomaly detection, real-time monitoring, security analytics, and operational analytics. \\nQueries can be optimized and sped up with the use of indexes. \\nDepending on the type of company you work at, you may use search databases either \\nregularly or not at all. Regardless, it’s good to be aware they exist in case you come \\nacross them in the wild. Search databases are popular for fast search and retrieval and \\ncan be found in various applications; an ecommerce site may power its product search \\nusing a search database.

A time series is a series of values organized by time. For example, \\nstock prices might move as trades are executed throughout the day, or a weather sensor \\nwill take atmospheric temperatures every minute. Any events that are recorded over \\ntime—either regularly or sporadically—are time-series data. A time-series database is \\noptimized for retrieving and statistical processing of time-series data. \\nWhile time-series data such as orders, shipments, logs, and so forth have been stored \\nin relational databases for ages, these data sizes and volumes were often tiny. As data \\ngrew faster and bigger, new special -purpose databases were needed. Time -series \\ndatabases address the needs of growing, high -velocity data volumes from IoT, event \\nand application logs, ad tech, and fintech, among many other use cases. Often these \\nworkloads are write -heavy. As a result, time -series databases often utilize memory \\nbuffering to support fast writes and reads. \\nWe should distinguish between measurement and event-based data, common in time-\\nseries databases. Measurement data is generated regularly, such as temperature or air-\\nquality sensors. Event-based data is irregular and created every time an event occurs—\\nfor instance, when a motion sensor detects movement. \\nThe schema for a time series typically contains a timestamp and a small set of fields. \\nBecause the data is time-dependent, the data is ordered by the timestamp. This makes \\ntime-series databases suitable for operational analytics but not great for BI use ca ses. \\nJoins are not common, though some quasi time-series databases such as Apache Druid \\nsupport joins. Many time-series databases are available, both as open source and paid \\noptions. \\nAPIs \\nAPIs are now a standard and pervasive way of exchanging data in the cloud, for SaaS \\nplatforms, and between internal company systems. Many types of API interfaces exist \\nacross the web, but we are principally interested in those built around HTTP, the most \\npopular type on the web and in the cloud. \\nREST \\nWe’ll first talk about REST, currently the dominant API paradigm. As noted in Chapter \\n4, REST stands for representational state transfer . This set of practices and \\nphilosophies for building HTTP web APIs was laid out by Roy Fielding in 2000 in a \\nPhD dissertation. REST is built around HTTP verbs, such as GET and PUT; in practice, \\nmodern REST uses only a handful of the verb mappings outlined  in the original \\ndissertation. \\nOne of the principal ideas of REST is that interactions are stateless. Unlike in a Linux \\nterminal session, there is no notion of a session with associated state variables such as \\na working directory; each REST call is independent. REST calls can change the'),\n",

In some cases, APIs are merely a \\nthin wrapper over internals that provides the minimum functionality required to protect \\nthe system from user requests. In other examples, a REST data API is a masterpiece of \\nengineering that prepares data for analytics applications and supports advanced \\nreporting. \\nA couple of developments have simplified setting up data -ingestion pipelines from \\nREST APIs. First, data providers frequently supply client libraries in various \\nlanguages, especially in Python. Client libraries remove much of the boilerplate labor \\nof build ing API interaction code. Client libraries handle critical details such as \\nauthentication and map fundamental methods into accessible classes. \\nSecond, various services and open source libraries have emerged to interact with APIs \\nand manage data synchronization. Many SaaS and open source vendors provide off -\\nthe-shelf connectors for common APIs. Platforms also simplify the process of building \\ncustom connectors as required. \\nThere are numerous data APIs without client libraries or out -of-the-box connector \\nsupport. As we emphasize throughout the book, engineers would do well to reduce \\nundifferentiated heavy lifting by using off -the-shelf tools. However, low -level \\nplumbing tasks still consume many resources. At virtually any large company, data \\nengineers will need to deal with the problem of writing and maintaining custom code \\nto pull data from APIs, which requires understanding the structure of the data as \\nprovided, developing appropriate data-extraction code, and determining a suitable data \\nsynchronization strategy. \\nGraphQL \\nGraphQL was created at Facebook as a query language for application data and an \\nalternative to generic REST APIs. Whereas REST APIs generally restrict your queries \\nto a specific data model, GraphQL opens up the possibility of retrieving multiple data \\nmodels in a single request. This allows for more flexible and expressive queries than \\nwith REST. GraphQL is built around JSON and returns data in a shape resembling the \\nJSON query. \\n \\n66  For one example, see Michael S.

In reality, engineers will \\nencounter both as they interact with source systems. \\nWebhooks \\nWebhooks are a simple event-based data-transmission pattern. The data source can be \\nan application backend, a web page, or a mobile app. When specified events happen in \\nthe source system, this triggers a call to an HTTP endpoint hosted by the data \\nconsumer. Notice that the connection goes from the source system to the data sink, the \\nopposite of typical APIs. For this reason, webhooks are often called reverse APIs. \\nThe endpoint can do various things with the POST event data, potentially triggering a \\ndownstream process or storing the data for future use. For analytics purposes, we’re \\ninterested in collecting these events. Engineers commonly use message queues to \\ningest data at high velocity and volume. We will talk about message queues and event \\nstreams later in this chapter. \\nRPC and gRPC \\nA remote procedure call (RPC) is commonly used in distributed computing. It allows \\nyou to run a procedure on a remote system. \\ngRPC is a remote procedure call library developed internally at Google in 2015 and \\nlater released as an open standard. Its use at Google alone would be enough to merit \\ninclusion in our discussion. Many Google services, such as Google Ads and GCP, offer \\ngRPC APIs. gRPC is built around the Protocol Buffers open data serialization standard, \\nalso developed by Google. \\ngRPC emphasizes the efficient bidirectional exchange of data over HTTP/2. Efficiency \\nrefers to aspects such as CPU utilization, power consumption, battery life, and \\nbandwidth. Like GraphQL, gRPC imposes much more specific technical standards \\nthan REST, thus allowing the use of common client libraries and allowing engineers \\nto develop a skill set that will apply to any gRPC interaction code. \\nData Sharing \\nThe core concept of cloud data sharing is that a multitenant system supports security \\npolicies for sharing data among tenants. Concretely, any public cloud object storage \\nsystem with a fine -grained permission system can be a platform for data sharing. \\nPopular cloud data -warehouse platforms also support data -sharing capabilities. Of \\ncourse, data can also be shared through download or exchange over email, but a \\nmultitenant system makes the process much easier.'),\n",

Data \\nmarketplaces provide a centralized location for data commerce, where data providers \\ncan advertise their offerings and sell them without worrying about the details of \\nmanaging network access to data systems. \\nData sharing can also streamline data pipelines within an organization. Data sharing \\nallows units of an organization to manage their data and selectively share it with other \\nunits while still allowing individual units to manage their compute and query cost s \\nseparately, facilitating data decentralization. This facilitates decentralized data \\nmanagement patterns such as data mesh.67 \\nData sharing and data mesh align closely with our philosophy of common architecture \\ncomponents. Choose common components (see Chapter 3) that allow the simple and \\nefficient interchange of data and expertise rather than embracing the most exciting and \\nsophisticated technology. \\nThird-Party Data Sources \\nThe consumerization of technology means every company is essentially now a \\ntechnology company. The consequence is that these companies —and increasingly \\ngovernment agencies—want to make their data available to their customers and users, \\neither as part of their service or as a separate subscription. For example, the US Bureau \\nof Labor Statistics publishes various statistics about the US labor market. The National \\nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) publishes various data from its \\nresearch initiatives.  Facebook shares data with businesses that advertise on its \\nplatform. \\nWhy would companies want to make their data available? Data is sticky, and a flywheel \\nis created by allowing users to integrate and extend their application into a user’s \\napplication. Greater user adoption and usage means more data, which means users can \\nintegrate more data into their applications and data systems. The side effect is there are \\nnow almost infinite sources of third-party data. \\nDirect third-party data access is commonly done via APIs, through data sharing on a \\ncloud platform, or through data download. APIs often provide deep integration \\ncapabilities, allowing customers to pull and push data.

Second, the rise of data apps —applications that \\ndirectly integrate real-time analytics—are growing from strength to strength. Event -\\ndriven architectures are ideal in this setting because events can both trigger work in the \\napplication and feed near real-time analytics. \\nPlease note that streaming data (in this case, messages and streams) cuts across many \\ndata engineering lifecycle stages. Unlike an RDBMS, which is often directly attached \\nto an application, the lines of streaming data are sometimes less clear -cut. These \\nsystems are used as source systems, but they will often cut across the data engineering \\nlifecycle because of their transient nature. For example, you can use an event -\\nstreaming platform for message passing in an event -driven application, a source \\nsystem. The  same event -streaming platform can be used in the ingestion and \\ntransformation stage to process data for real-time analytics. \\nAs source systems, message queues and event -streaming platforms are used in \\nnumerous ways, from routing messages between microservices ingesting millions of \\nevents per second of event data from web, mobile, and IoT applications. Let’s look at \\nmessage queues and event-streaming platforms a bit more closely. \\nMessage queues \\nA message queue  is a mechanism to asynchronously send data (usually as small \\nindividual messages, in the kilobytes) between discrete systems using a publish and \\nsubscribe model. Data is published to a message queue and is delivered to one or more \\nsubscribers ( Figure 5 -9). The subscriber acknowledges receipt of the message, \\nremoving it from the queue. \\n \\nFigure 5-9.

Some things to keep in mind with message queues are frequency of \\ndelivery, message ordering, and scalability. \\nMessage ordering and delivery.    The order in which messages are created, sent, \\nand received can significantly impact downstream subscribers. In general, order in \\ndistributed message queues is a tricky problem. Message queues often apply a fuzzy \\nnotion of order and first in, first out (FI FO). Strict FIFO means that if message A is \\ningested before message B, message A will always be delivered before message B. In \\npractice, messages might be published and received out of order, especially in highly \\ndistributed message systems. \\nFor example, Amazon SQS standard queues make the best effort to preserve message \\norder. SQS also offers FIFO queues, which offer much stronger guarantees at the cost \\nof extra overhead. \\nIn general, don’t assume that your messages will be delivered in order unless your \\nmessage queue technology guarantees it. You typically need to design for out-oforder \\nmessage delivery. \\nDelivery frequency.    Messages can be sent exactly once or at least once. If a message \\nis sent exactly once, then after the subscriber acknowledges the message, the message \\ndisappears and won’t be delivered again. 68  Messages sent at least once  can be \\nconsumed by multiple subscribers or by the same subscriber more than once. This is \\ngreat when duplications or redundancy don’t matter. \\nIdeally, systems should be idempotent. In an idempotent system, the outcome of \\nprocessing a message once is identical to the outcome of processing it multiple times. \\nThis helps to account for a variety of subtle scenarios. For example, even if our system \\ncan guarantee exactly-once delivery, a consumer might fully process a message but fail \\nright before acknowledging processing. The message will effectively be processed \\ntwice, but an idempotent system handles this scenario gracefully. \\nScalability.    The most popular message queues utilized in event-driven applications \\nare horizontally scalable, running across multiple servers. This allows these queues to \\nscale up and down dynamically, buffer messages when systems fall behind, and \\n \\n68 Whether exactly once is possible is a semantical debate.

As discussed previously in this \\nchapter, the big difference between messages and streams is that a message queue is \\nprimarily used to route messages with certain  delivery guarantees. In contrast, an \\nevent-streaming platform is used to ingest and process data in an ordered log of \\nrecords. In an event-streaming platform, data is retained for a while, and it is possible \\nto replay messages from a past point in time. \\nLet’s describe an event related to an event -streaming platform. As mentioned in \\nChapter 3, an event is “something that happened, typically a change in the state of \\nsomething.” An event has the following features: a key, a value, and a timestamp. \\nMultiple key-value timestamps might be contained in a single event.

In an event -streaming platform, a producer streams events to a topic, a \\ncollection of related events. A topic might contain fraud alerts, customer orders, or \\ntemperature readings from IoT devices, for example. A topic can have zero, one, or \\nmultiple producers and customers on most event-streaming platforms. \\nUsing the preceding event example, a topic might be web orders. Also, let’s send \\nthis topic to a couple of consumers, such as fulfillment and marketing.

An SLA provides \\nexpectations of what you can expect from the source systems you rely upon. An \\nexample of an SLA might be “data from source systems will be reliably available and \\nof high quality.” A service-level objective (SLO) measures performance against what \\nyou’ve agreed to in the SLA. For example, given your example SLA, an SLO might \\nbe “source systems will have 99% uptime.” If a data contract or SLA/SLO seems too \\nformal, at least verbally set expectations for source system guarantees for uptime, data \\nquality, and anything else of importance to you.

The data engineer should get as much upstream support as \\npossible to ensure that the undercurrents are applied when data is generated in source \\nsystems.

Magnetic disk head movement and rotation are essential in random \\naccess latency \\nIBM developed magnetic disk drive technology in the 1950s. Since then, magnetic disk \\ncapacities have grown steadily. The first commercial magnetic disk drive, the IBM \\n350, had a capacity of 3.75 megabytes. As of this writing, magnetic drives storing 20 \\nTB are commercially available. In fact, magnetic disks continue to see rapid \\ninnovation, with methods such as heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), shingled \\nmagnetic recording (SMR), and helium -filled disk enclosures being used to realize \\never greater stor age densities. In spite of the continuing improvements in drive \\ncapacity, other aspects of HDD performance are hampered by physics. \\nFirst, disk transfer speed, the rate at which data can be read and written, does not scale \\nin proportion with disk capacity. Disk capacity scales with areal density (gigabits \\nstored per square inch), whereas transfer speed scales with linear density (bits per \\ninch). This means that if disk capacity grows by a factor of 4, transfer speed increases \\nby only a factor of 2. Consequently, current data center drives support maximum data \\ntransfer speeds of 200 –300 MB/s. To frame this another way, it takes mo re than 20 \\nhours to read the entire contents of a 30 TB magnetic drive, assuming a transfer speed \\nof 300 MB/s. \\nA second major limitation is seek time. To access data, the drive must physically \\nrelocate the read/write heads to the appropriate track on the disk. Third, in order to find \\na particular piece of data on the disk, the disk controller must wait for that data to rotate \\nunder the read/write heads. This leads to rotational latency. Typical commercial drives \\nspinning at 7,200 revolutions per minute (RPM) seek time, and rotational latency, leads \\nto over four milliseconds of overall average latency (time to access a selected piece of'),\n",

A fourth limitation is input/output operations per second (IOPS), critical for \\ntransactional databases. A magnetic drive ranges from 50 to 500 IOPS. \\nVarious tricks can improve latency and transfer speed. Using a higher rotational speed \\ncan increase transfer rate and decrease rotational latency. Limiting the radius of the \\ndisk platter or writing data into only a narrow band on the disk reduces seek time . \\nHowever, none of these techniques makes magnetic drives remotely competitive with \\nSSDs for random access lookups. SSDs can deliver data with significantly lower \\nlatency, higher IOPS, and higher transfer speeds, partially because there is no \\nphysically rotating disk or magnetic head to wait for. \\nAs mentioned earlier, magnetic disks are still prized in data centers for their low \\ndatastorage costs. In addition, magnetic drives can sustain extraordinarily high transfer \\nrates through parallelism. This is the critical idea behind cloud object storage: data can \\nbe distributed across thousands of disks in clusters. Data -transfer rates go up \\ndramatically by reading from numerous disks simultaneously, limited primarily by \\nnetwork performance rather than disk transfer rate. Thus, network components and \\nCPUs are also key raw ingredients in storage systems, and we will return to these topics \\nshortly. \\nSolid-State Drive \\nSolid-state drives (SSDs) store data as charges in flash memory cells. SSDs eliminate \\nthe mechanical components of magnetic drives; the data is read by purely electronic \\nmeans. SSDs can look up random data in less than 0.1 ms (100 microseconds). In \\naddition, SSDs can scale both data-transfer speeds and IOPS by slicing storage into \\npartitions with numerous storage controllers running in parallel. Commercial SSDs can \\nsupport transfer speeds of many gigabytes per second and tens of thousands of IOPS. \\nBecause of these exceptional performance characteristics, SSDs have revolutionized \\ntransactional databases and are the accepted standard for commercial deployments of \\nOLTP systems. SSDs allow relational databases such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, and \\nSQL Server to handle thousands of transactions per second. \\nHowever, SSDs are not currently the default option for high -scale analytics data \\nstorage. Again, this comes down to cost. Commercial SSDs typically cost 20–30 cents \\n(USD) per gigabyte of capacity, nearly 10 times the cost per capacity of a magnetic \\ndrive. Thus, object storage on magnetic disks has emerged as the leading option for \\nlarge-scale data storage in data lakes and cloud data warehouses. \\nSSDs still play a significant role in OLAP systems. Some OLAP databases leverage \\nSSD caching to support high-performance queries on frequently accessed data.

Data stored in system memory by software is generally \\nnot in a format suitable for storage on disk or transmission over a network. \\nSerialization is the process of flattening and packing data into a standard format that a \\nreader will be able to decode. Serialization formats provide a standard of data \\nexchange. We might encode data in a row -based manner as an XML, JSON, or CSV \\nfile and pass it to another user who can then decode it using a standard library. A \\nserialization algorithm has logic for handling types, imposes rules on data structure, \\nand allows exchange between programming languages and CPUs. The serialization \\nalgorithm also has rules for handling exceptions. For instance, Python objects can \\ncontain cyclic references;  the serialization algorithm might throw an error or limit \\nnesting depth on encountering a cycle. \\nLow-level database storage is also a form of serialization. Row -oriented relational \\ndatabases organize data as rows on disk to support speedy lookups and in -place \\nupdates. Columnar databases organize data into column files to optimize for highly \\nefficient compression and support fast scans of large data volumes. Each serialization \\nchoice comes with a set of trade-offs, and data engineers tune these choices to optimize \\nperformance to requirements. \\nWe provide a more detailed catalog of common data serialization techniques and \\nformats in Appendix A. We suggest that data engineers become familiar with common \\nserialization practices and formats, especially the most popular current formats (e.g., \\nApache Parquet), hybrid serialization (e.g., Apache Hudi), and in-memory serialization \\n(e.g., Apache Arrow). \\nCompression \\nCompression is another critical component of storage engineering. On a basic level, \\ncompression makes data smaller, but compression algorithms interact with other \\ndetails of storage systems in complex ways. \\nHighly efficient compression has three main advantages in storage systems. First, the \\ndata is smaller and thus takes up less space on the disk. Second, compression increases \\nthe practical scan speed per disk. With a 10:1 compression ratio, we go from scanning \\n200 MB/s per magnetic disk to an effective rate of 2 GB/s per disk. \\nThe third advantage is in network performance. Given that a network connection \\nbetween an Amazon EC2 instance and S3 provides 10 gigabits per second (Gbps) of \\nbandwidth, a 10:1 compression ratio increases effective network bandwidth to 100 \\nGbps.'),\n",

Compressing and decompressing data \\nentails extra time and resource consumption to read or write data. We undertake a more \\ndetailed discussion of compression algorithms and trade-offs in Appendix A. \\nCaching \\nWe’ve already mentioned caching in our discussion of RAM. The core idea of caching \\nis to store frequently or recently accessed data in a fast access layer. The faster the \\ncache, the higher the cost and the less storage space available. Less frequently accessed \\ndata is stored in cheaper, slower storage. Caches are critical for data serving, \\nprocessing, and transformation. \\nAs we analyze storage systems, it is helpful to put every type of storage we utilize \\ninside a cache hierarchy (Table 6-1). Most practical data systems rely on many cache \\nlayers assembled from storage with varying performance characteristics. This starts \\ninside CPUs; processors may deploy up to four cache tiers. We move down the \\nhierarchy to RAM and SSDs. Cloud object storag e is a lower tier that supports long -\\nterm data retention and durability while allowing for data serving and dynamic data \\nmovement in pipelines. \\nTable 6-1.

For example, \\nmagnetic disks are a raw storage ingredient, while major cloud object storage platforms \\nand HDFS are storage systems that utilize magnetic disks. Still higher levels of storage \\nabstraction exist, such as data lakes and lakehouses (which we cover in “Data \\nEngineering Storage Abstractions” on page 215). \\nSingle Machine Versus Distributed Storage \\nAs data storage and access patterns become more complex and outgrow the usefulness \\nof a single server, distributing data to more than one server becomes necessary. Data \\ncan be stored on multiple servers, known as distributed storage. This is a distributed \\nsystem whose purpose is to store data in a distributed fashion (Figure 6-4). \\n \\nFigure 6-4. Single machine versus distributed storage on multiple servers \\nDistributed storage coordinates the activities of multiple servers to store, retrieve, and \\nprocess data faster and at a larger scale, all while providing redundancy in case a server \\nbecomes unavailable. Distributed storage is common in architectures where you want \\nbuilt-in redundancy and scalability for large amounts of data. For example, object \\nstorage, Apache Spark, and cloud data warehouses rely on distributed storage \\narchitectures. \\nData engineers must always be aware of the consistency paradigms of the distributed \\nsystems, which we’ll explore next. \\nEventual Versus Strong Consistency \\nA challenge with distributed systems is that your data is spread across multiple servers. \\nHow does this system keep the data consistent? Unfortunately, distributed systems \\npose a dilemma for storage and query accuracy. It takes time to replicate changes across \\nthe nodes of a system; often a balance exists between getting current data and getting \\n“sorta” current data in a distributed database. Let’s look at two common consistency \\npatterns in distributed systems: eventual and strong. \\nWe’ve covered ACID compliance throughout this book, starting in Chapter 5.

Think of it as the opposite of ACID. BASE is the basis of eventual \\nconsistency. Let’s briefly explore its components: \\nBasically available \\nConsistency is not guaranteed, but database reads and writes are made on a best -\\neffort basis, meaning consistent data is available most of the time. \\nSoft-state \\nThe state of the transaction is fuzzy, and it’s uncertain whether the transaction is \\ncommitted or uncommitted. \\nEventual consistency \\nAt some point, reading data will return consistent values. \\nIf reading data in an eventually consistent system is unreliable, why use it? Eventual \\nconsistency is a common trade -off in large-scale, distributed systems. If you want to \\nscale horizontally (across multiple nodes) to process data in high volumes, then \\neventually, consistency is often the price you’ll pay. Eventual consistency allows you \\nto retrieve data quickly without verifying that you have the latest version across all \\nnodes. \\nThe opposite of eventual consistency is strong consistency. With strong consistency, \\nthe distributed database ensures that writes to any node are first distributed with a \\nconsensus and that any reads against the database return consistent values. You’ll use \\nstrong consistency when you can tolerate higher query latency and require correct data \\nevery time you read from the database. \\nGenerally, data engineers make decisions about consistency in three places. First, the \\ndatabase technology itself sets the stage for a certain level of consistency. Second, \\nconfiguration parameters for the database will have an impact on consistency. Third , \\ndatabases often support some consistency configuration at an individual query level. \\nFor example, DynamoDB supports eventually consistent reads and strongly consistent \\nreads. Strongly consistent reads are slower and consume more resources, so it is best \\nto use them sparingly, but they are available when consistency is required. You should \\nunderstand how your da tabase handles consistency. Again, data engineers are tasked \\nwith understanding technology deeply and using it to solve problems appropriately. A \\ndata engineer might need to negotiate consistency requirements with other technical \\nand business stakeholders.

A file is a data \\nentity with specific read, write, and reference characteristics used by software and \\noperating systems. We define a file to have the following characteristics: \\nFinite length \\nA file is a finite-length stream of bytes. \\nAppend operations \\nWe can append bytes to the file up to the limits of the host storage system. \\nRandom access \\nWe can read from any location in the file or write updates to any location. Object \\nstorage behaves much like file storage but with key differences. While we set the stage \\nfor object storage by discussing file storage first, object storage is arguably much more \\nimportant for the type of data engineering you’ll do today. We will forward-reference \\nthe object storage discussion extensively over the next few pages. \\nFile storage systems organize files into a directory tree. The directory reference for a \\nfile might look like this: \\n/Users/matthewhousley/output.txt \\nWhen this file reference is passed to the operating system, it starts at the root directory \\n/, finds Users, matthewhousley, and finally output.txt. Working from the left, \\neach directory is contained inside a parent directory, until we finally reach the file \\noutput.txt. This example uses Unix semantics, but Windows file reference \\nsemantics are similar. The filesystem stores each directory as metadata about the files \\nand directories that it contains. This metadata consists of the name of each entity, \\nrelevant permission details, and a pointer to the actual entity. To find a file on disk, the \\noperating system looks at the metadata at each hierarchy level and follows the pointer \\nto the next subdirectory entity until finally reaching the file itself. \\nNote that other file -like data entities generally don’t necessarily have all these \\nproperties. For example, objects in object storage support only the first characteristic, \\nfinite length, but are still extremely useful. We discuss this in “Object Storage” on page \\n205. \\nIn cases where file storage paradigms are necessary for a pipeline, be careful with state \\nand try to use ephemeral environments as much as possible.

Filesystems \\nare designed to write data to allow for easy recovery in the event of power loss during \\na write, though any unwritten data will still be lost. \\nLocal filesystems generally support full read after write consistency; reading \\nimmediately after a write will return the written data. Operating systems also employ \\nvarious locking strategies to manage concurrent writing attempts to a file. \\nLocal disk filesystems may also support advanced features such as journaling, \\nsnapshots, redundancy, the extension of the filesystem across multiple disks, full disk \\nencryption, and compression.

In the cloud, virtualized block storage is the standard for VMs. These \\nblock storage abstractions allow fine control of storage size, scalability, and data \\ndurability beyond that offered by raw disks. \\nIn our earlier discussion of SSDs and magnetic disks, we mentioned that with these \\nrandom-access devices, the operating system can seek, read, and write any data on the \\ndisk. A block is the smallest addressable unit of data supported by a disk. This was \\noften 512 bytes of usable data on older disks, but it has now grown to 4,096 bytes for \\nmost current disks, making writes less fine -grained but dramatically reducing the \\noverhead of man aging blocks. Blocks typically contain extra bits for error \\ndetection/correction and other metadata. \\nBlocks on magnetic disks are geometrically arranged on a physical platter. Two blocks \\non the same track can be read without moving the head, while reading two blocks on \\nseparate tracks requires a seek. Seek time can occur between blocks on an SSD, but \\nthis is infinitesimal compared to the seek time for magnetic disk tracks. \\nBlock storage applications \\nTransactional database systems generally access disks at a block level to lay out data \\nfor optimal performance. For row-oriented databases, this originally meant that rows \\nof data were written as continuous streams; the situation has grown more complicated \\nwith the arrival of SSDs and their associated seek -time performance improvements, \\nbut transactional databases still rely on the high random access performance offered \\nby direct access to a block storage device. \\nBlock storage also remains the default option for operating system boot disks on cloud \\nVMs. The block device is formatted much as it would be directly on a physical disk, \\nbut the storage is usually virtualized.

This allows EBS volumes to \\npersist when an EC2 instance shuts down, when a host server fails, or even when the \\ninstance is deleted.

We lose much of the \\nwriting flexibility we expect with file storage on a local disk in an object store.

Although cloud object \\nstores may appear to support directory tree semantics, no true directory hierarchy \\nexists. We might store an object with the following full path: \\nS3://oreilly-data-engineering-book/project-data/11/23/2021/data.txt \\nOn the surface, this looks like subdirectories you might find in a regular file folder \\nsystem: project-data, 11, 23, and 2021. Many cloud console interfaces allow \\nusers to view the objects inside a “directory,” and cloud command -line tools often \\nsupport Unix-style commands such as ls inside an object store directory. However, \\nbehind the scenes, the object system does not traverse a directory tree to reach the \\nobject. Instead, it simply sees a key ( project-data/11/23/2021/data.txt) \\nthat happens to match dire ctory semantics. This might seem like a minor technical \\ndetail, but engineers need to understand that certain “directory” -level operations are \\ncostly in an object store. To run aws ls S3://oreilly-data-engineering-\\nbook/projectdata/11/ the object store must filter keys on the key prefix \\nproject-data/11/. If the bucket contains millions of objects, this operation might \\ntake some time, even if the “subdirectory” houses only a few objects. \\nObject consistency and versioning \\nAs mentioned, object stores don’t support in -place updates or appends as a general \\nrule. We write a new object under the same key to update an object. When data \\nengineers utilize updates in data processes, they must be aware of the consistency \\nmodel for the object store they’re using. Object stores may be eventually consistent or \\nstrongly consistent. For example, until recently, S3 was eventually consistent; after a \\nnew version of an object was written under the same key, the object store might \\nsometimes re turn the old version of the object.

One approach is to add a \\nstrongly consistent database (e.g., PostgreSQL) to the mix. Writing an object is now a \\ntwo-step process: \\n1. Write the object. \\n2. Write the returned metadata for the object version to the strongly consistent \\ndatabase. \\nThe version metadata (an object hash or an object timestamp) can uniquely identify an \\nobject version in conjunction with the object key. To read an object, a reader undertakes \\nthe following steps: \\n1. Fetch the latest object metadata from the strongly consistent database. \\n2. Query object metadata using the object key. Read the object data if it matches the \\nmetadata fetched from the consistent database. \\n3. If the object metadata does not match, repeat step 2 until the latest version of the \\nobject is returned. \\nA practical implementation has exceptions and edge cases to consider, such as when \\nthe object gets rewritten during this querying process. These steps can be managed \\nbehind an API so that an object reader sees a strongly consistent object store at the cost \\nof higher latency for object access. \\nObject versioning is closely related to object consistency. When we rewrite an object \\nunder an existing key in an object store, we’re essentially writing a brand-new object, \\nsetting references from the existing key to the object, and deleting the old objec t \\nreferences. Updating all references across the cluster takes time, hence the potential \\nfor stale reads. Eventually, the storage cluster garbage collector deallocates the space \\ndedicated to the dereferenced data, recycling disk capacity for use by new objects. \\nWith object versioning turned on, we add additional metadata to the object that \\nstipulates a version.

The consistency issue still exists when \\na client requests the “default” or “latest” version of an object. \\nThe principal overhead that engineers need to consider with object versioning is the \\ncost of storage. Historical versions of objects generally have the same associated \\nstorage costs as current versions.

We use the term reduced access here because \\nmany of these storage tiers still make data highly available, but with high retrieval \\ncosts in exchange for reduced storage costs. \\nLet’s look at a couple of examples in S3 since Amazon is a benchmark for cloud service \\nstandards. The S3 Standard-Infrequent Access storage class discounts monthly storage \\ncosts for increased data retrieval costs.

Tools like \\ns3fs and Amazon S3 File Gateway allow users to mount an S3 bucket as local storage. \\nUsers of these tools should be aware of the characteristics of writes to the filesystem \\nand how these will interact with the characteristics and pricing of object storage.

Hadoop is \\nsimilar to object storage but with a key difference: Hadoop combines compute and \\nstorage on the same nodes, where object stores typically have limited support for \\ninternal processing. \\nHadoop breaks large files into blocks, chunks of data less than a few hundred \\nmegabytes in size. The filesystem is managed by the NameNode, which maintains \\ndirectories, file metadata, and a detailed catalog describing the location of file blocks \\nin the cluster. In a typical configuration, each block of data is replicated to three nodes. \\nThis increases both the durability and availability of data. If a disk or node fails, the \\nreplication factor for some file blocks will fall below 3. The NameNode will instru ct \\nother nodes to replicate these file blocks so that they again reach the correct replication \\nfactor. Thus, the probability of losing data is very low, barring a correlated failure (e.g., \\nan asteroid hitting the data center). \\nHadoop is not simply a storage system. Hadoop combines compute resources with \\nstorage nodes to allow in-place data processing. This was originally achieved using the \\nMapReduce programming model, which we discuss in Chapter 8. \\nHadoop is dead. Long live Hadoop! \\nWe often see claims that Hadoop is dead. This is only partially true. Hadoop is no \\nlonger a hot, bleeding-edge technology. Many Hadoop ecosystem tools such as Apache \\nPig are now on life support and primarily used to run legacy jobs. The pure MapReduce \\nprogramming model has fallen by the wayside. HDFS remains widely used in various \\napplications and organizations. \\nHadoop still appears in many legacy installations. Many organizations that adopted \\nHadoop during the peak of the big data craze have no immediate plans to migrate to \\nnewer technologies. This is a good choice for companies that run massive \\n(thousandnode) Hadoop clusters and have the resources to maintain on -premises \\nsystems effectively. Smaller companies may want to reconsider the cost overhead and \\nscale limitations of running a small Hadoop cluster against migrating to cloud \\nsolutions. \\nIn addition, HDFS is a key ingredient of many current big data engines, such as \\nAmazon EMR. In fact, Apache Spark is still commonly run on HDFS clusters. We \\ndiscuss this in more detail in “Separation of Compute from Storage” on page 220.'),\n",

In the case \\nof message queues, stored data is temporal and expected to disappear after a certain \\nduration. However, distributed, scalable streaming frameworks like Apache Kafka now \\nallow extremely long-duration streaming data retention. Kafka supports indefinite data \\nretention by pushing old, infrequently accessed messages down to object storage. \\nKafka competitors (including Amazon Kinesis, Apache Pulsar, and Google Cloud \\nPub/Sub) also support long data retention. \\nClosely related to data retention in these systems is the notion of replay. Replay allows \\na streaming system to return a range of historical stored data. Replay is the standard \\ndata-retrieval mechanism for streaming storage systems. Replay can be used to run \\nbatch queries over a time range or to reprocess data in a streaming pipeline. Chapter 7 \\ncovers replay in more depth. \\nOther storage engines have emerged for real -time analytics applications. In some \\nsense, transactional databases emerged as the first real -time query engines; data \\nbecomes visible to queries as soon as it is written.

While scalable versions of row-oriented transactional databases \\nhave overcome some of these limitations, they are still not truly optimized for analytics \\nat scale. \\nIndexes, Partitioning, and Clustering \\nIndexes provide a map of the table for particular fields and allow extremely fast lookup \\nof individual records.

Indexes can \\nalso be applied to other columns to serve the needs of specific applications. Using \\nindexes, an RDBMS can look up and update thousands of rows per second. \\nWe do not cover transactional database records in depth in this book; numerous \\ntechnical resources are available on this topic.

In addition, arranging data by column packs similar values next to each other, \\nyielding high -compression ratios with minimal compression overhead. This allows \\ndata to be scanned more quickly from disk and over a network. \\nColumnar databases perform poorly for transactional use cases —i.e., when we try to \\nlook up large numbers of individual rows asynchronously. However, they perform \\nextremely well when large quantities of data must be scanned—e.g., for complex data \\ntransformations, aggregations, statistical calculations, or evaluation of complex \\nconditions on large datasets. \\nIn the past, columnar databases performed poorly on joins, so the advice for data \\nengineers was to denormalize data, using wide schemas, arrays, and nested data \\nwherever possible. Join performance for columnar databases has improved \\ndramatically in recent years, so while there can still be performance advantages in \\ndenormalization, this is no longer a necessity. You’ll learn more about normalization \\nand denormalization in Chapter 8. \\nFrom indexes to partitions and clustering \\nWhile columnar databases allow for fast scan speeds, it’s still helpful to reduce the \\namount of data scanned as much as possible. In addition to scanning only data in \\ncolumns relevant to a query, we can partition a table into multiple subtables by splitting \\nit on a field. It is quite common in analytics and data science use cases to scan over a \\ntime range, so date - and time -based partitioning is extremely common. Columnar \\ndatabases generally support a variety of other partition schemes as well. \\nClusters allow finer-grained organization of data within partitions. A clustering scheme \\napplied within a columnar database sorts data by one or a few fields, colocating similar \\nvalues. This improves performance for filtering, sorting, and joining these values. \\nExample: Snowflake micro-partitioning \\nWe mention Snowflake micro-partitioning because it’s a good example of recent \\ndevelopments and evolution in approaches to columnar storage. Micro partitions are \\nsets of rows between 50 and 500 megabytes in uncompressed size. Snowflake uses an \\nalgorithmic approach that attempts to cluster together similar rows.

Data catalogs make \\nmetadata easily available to systems. For instance, a data catalog is a key ingredient of \\nthe data lakehouse, allowing table discoverability for queries. \\nOrganizationally, data catalogs allow business users, analysts, data scientists, and \\nengineers to search for data to answer questions. Data catalogs streamline \\ncrossorganizational communications and collaboration. \\nData Sharing \\nData sharing allows organizations and individuals to share specific data and carefully \\ndefined permissions with specific entities. Data sharing allows data scientists to share \\ndata from a sandbox with their collaborators within an organization. Across \\norganizations, data sharing facilitates collaboration between partner businesses. For \\nexample, an ad tech company can share advertising data with its customers. \\nA cloud multitenant environment makes interorganizational collaboration much easier. \\nHowever, it also presents new security challenges. Organizations must carefully \\ncontrol policies that govern who can share data with whom to prevent accidental \\nexposure or deliberate exfiltration. \\nData sharing is a core feature of many cloud data platforms. See Chapter 5 for a more \\nextensive discussion of data sharing. \\nSchema \\nWhat is the expected form of the data? What is the file format? Is it structured, \\nsemistructured, or unstructured? What data types are expected? How does the data fit \\ninto a larger hierarchy? Is it connected to other data through shared keys or other \\nrelationships? \\nNote that schema need not be relational. Rather, data becomes more useful when we \\nhave as much information about its structure and organization. For images stored in a \\ndata lake, this schema information might explain the image format, resolution, and the \\nway the images fit into a larger hierarchy. \\nSchema can function as a sort of Rosetta stone, instructions that tell us how to read the \\ndata. Two major schema patterns exist: schema on write and schema on read. Schema \\non write is essentially the traditional data warehouse pattern: a table has an integrated \\nschema; any writes to the table must conform. To support schema on write, a data lake \\nmust integrate a schema metastore. \\nWith schema on read, the schema is dynamically created when data is written, and a \\nreader must determine the schema when reading the data.

Schema on read emphasizes flexibility, \\nallowing virtually any data to be written. This comes at the cost of greater diff iculty \\nconsuming data in the future. \\nSeparation of Compute from Storage \\nA key idea we revisit throughout this book is the separation of compute from storage. \\nThis has emerged as a standard data access and query pattern in today’s cloud era. Data \\nlakes, as we discussed, store data in object stores and spin up temporary compute \\ncapacity to read and process it. Most fully managed OLAP products now rely on object \\nstorage behind the scenes. To understand the motivations for separating compute and \\nstorage, we should first look at the colocation of compute and storage. \\nColocation of compute and storage \\nColocation of compute and storage has long been a standard method to improve \\ndatabase performance. For transactional databases, data colocation allows fast, \\nlowlatency disk reads and high bandwidth. Even when we virtualize storage (e.g., \\nusing Amazon EBS), data is located relatively close to the host machine. \\nThe same basic idea applies for analytics query systems running across a cluster of \\nmachines. For example, with HDFS and MapReduce, the standard approach is to locate \\ndata blocks that need to be scanned in the cluster, and then push individual map jobs \\nout to these blocks. The data scan and processing for the map step are strictly local. \\nThe reduce step involves shuffling data across the cluster, but keeping map steps local \\neffectively preserves more bandwidth for shuffling, delivering better overall \\nperformance; map steps that filter heavily also dramatically reduce the amount of data \\nto be shuffled. \\nSeparation of compute and storage \\nIf colocation of compute and storage delivers high performance, why the shift toward \\nseparation of compute and storage? Several motivations exist. \\nEphemerality and scalability.    In the cloud, we’ve seen a dramatic shift toward \\nephemerality. In general, it’s cheaper to buy and host a server than to rent it from a \\ncloud provider, provided that you’re running it 24 hours a day nonstop for years on \\nend. In practice, workloads vary dramatically, and significant efficiencies are realized'),\n",

This is true for web \\nservers in online retail, and it is also true for big data batch jobs that may run only \\nperiodically. \\nEphemeral compute resources allow engineers to spin up massive clusters to complete \\njobs on time and then delete clusters when these jobs are done. The performance \\nbenefits of temporarily operating at ultra -high scale can outweigh the bandwidth \\nlimitations of object storage. \\nData durability and availability.    Cloud object stores significantly mitigate the risk \\nof data loss and generally provide extremely high uptime (availability). For example, \\nS3 stores data across multiple zones; if a natural disaster destroys a zone, data is still \\navailable from the remaining zones. Having multiple zones available also reduces the \\nodds of a data outage. If resources in one zone go down, engineers can spin up the \\nsame resources in a different zone. \\nThe potential for a misconfiguration that destroys data in object storage is still \\nsomewhat scary, but simple -to-deploy mitigations are available. Copying data to \\nmultiple cloud regions reduces this risk since configuration changes are generally \\ndeployed to only one region at a time. Replicating data to multiple storage providers \\ncan further reduce the risk. \\nHybrid separation and colocation \\nThe practical realities of separating compute from storage are more complicated than \\nwe’ve implied. In practice, we constantly hybridize colocation and separation to realize \\nthe benefits of both approaches. This hybridization is typically done in two ways:  \\nmultitier caching and hybrid object storage. \\nWith multitier caching , we utilize object storage for long -term data retention and \\naccess but spin up local storage to be used during queries and various stages of data \\npipelines. Both Google and Amazon offer versions of hybrid object storage (object \\nstorage that is tightly integrated with compute). \\nLet’s look at examples of how some popular processing engines hybridize separation \\nand colocation of storage and compute. \\nExample: AWS EMR with S3 and HDFS.    Big data services like Amazon EMR spin \\nup temporary HDFS clusters to process data. Engineers have the option of referencing \\nboth S3 and HDFS as a filesystem. A common pattern is to stand up HDFS on SSD \\ndrives, pull from S3, and save data from intermediate processing steps on local HDFS. \\nDoing so can realize significant performance gains over processing directly from S3.'),\n",

Other consumers read the output data directly from S3. \\nExample: Apache Spark.    In practice, Spark generally runs jobs on HDFS or some \\nother ephemeral distributed filesystem to support performant storage of data between \\nprocessing steps. In addition, Spark relies heavily on in -memory storage of data to \\nimprove processing. The problem with owning the infrastructure for running Spark is \\nthat dynamic RAM (DRAM) is extremely expensive; by separating compute and \\nstorage in the cloud, we can rent large quantities of memory and then release that \\nmemory when the job completes. \\nExample: Apache Druid.    Apache Druid relies heavily on SSDs to realize high \\nperformance. Since SSDs are significantly more expensive than magnetic disks, Druid \\nkeeps only one copy of data in its cluster, reducing “live” storage costs by a factor of \\nthree. \\nOf course, maintaining data durability is still critical, so Druid uses an object store as \\nits durability layer. When data is ingested, it’s processed, serialized into compressed \\ncolumns, and written to cluster SSDs and object storage. In the event of node  failure \\nor cluster data corruption, data can be automatically recovered to new nodes. In \\naddition, the cluster can be shut down and then fully recovered from SSD storage. \\nExample: Hybrid object storage.    Google’s Colossus file storage system supports \\nfinegrained control of data block location, although this functionality is not exposed \\ndirectly to the public. BigQuery uses this feature to colocate customer tables in a single \\nlocation, allowing ultra-high bandwidth for queries in that location.73 We refer to this \\nas hybrid object storage because it combines the clean abstractions of object storage \\nwith some advantages of colocating compute and storage. Amazon also offers some \\nnotion of hybrid object storage through S3 Select, a feature that allows users to filter \\nS3 data directly in S3 clusters before data is returned across the network. We speculate \\nthat public clouds will adopt hybrid object storage more widely to improve the \\nperformance of their offerings and make more efficient use of available network \\nresources. Some may be already doing so without disclosing this publicly. \\nThe concept of hybrid object storage underscores that there can still be advantages to \\nhaving low -level access to hardware rather than relying on someone else’s public \\ncloud. Public cloud services do not expose low-level details of hardware and systems \\n(e.g., data block locations for Colossus), but these details can be extremely useful in \\n \\n73 Valliappa Lakshmanan and Jordan Tigani, Google BigQuery: The Definitive Guide (Sebastopol, CA: \\nO’Reilly, 2019), 16–17, 188, https://oreil.ly/5aXXu.'),\n",

This \\ntypically means that a new virtual copy of an object is created (e.g., a new table) \\nwithout necessarily physically copying the underlying data. Typically, new pointers are \\ncreated to the raw data files, and future changes to these tables will not be recorded in \\nthe old table. For those familiar with the inner workings of object-oriented languages \\nsuch as Python, this type of “shallow” copying is familiar from other contexts. \\nZero-copy cloning is a compelling feature, but engineers must understand its strengths \\nand limitations. For example, cloning an object in a data lake environment and then \\ndeleting the files in the original object might also wipe out the new object. \\nFor fully managed object -store-based systems (e.g., Snowflake and BigQuery), \\nengineers need to be extremely familiar with the exact limits of shallow copying. \\nEngineers have more access to underlying object storage in data lake systems such as \\nDatabricks—a blessing and a curse. Data engineers should exercise great caution \\nbefore deleting any raw files in the underlying object store. Databricks and other data \\nlake management technologies sometimes also support a notion of deep copying , \\nwhereby all underlying data objects are copied. This is a more expensive process, but \\nalso more robust in the event that files are unintentionally lost or deleted. \\nData Storage Lifecycle and Data Retention \\nStoring data isn’t as simple as just saving it to object storage or disk and forgetting \\nabout it. You need to think about the data storage lifecycle and data retention. When \\nyou think about access frequency and use cases, ask, “How important is the data to  \\ndownstream users, and how often do they need to access it?” This is the data storage \\nlifecycle. Another question you should ask is, “How long should I keep this data?” Do \\nyou need to retain data indefinitely, or are you fine discarding it past a certain t ime \\nframe? This is data retention. Let’s dive into each of these. \\nHot, warm, and cold data \\nDid you know that data has a temperature?

Hot, warm, and cold data costs associated with access frequency \\nHot data.    Hot data has instant or frequent access requirements. The underlying \\nstorage for hot data is suited for fast access and reads, such as SSD or memory. Because \\nof the type of hardware involved with hot data, storing hot data is often the most \\nexpensive form of storage. Example use cases for hot data include retrieving product \\nrecommendations and product page results. The cost of storing hot data is the highest \\nof these three storage tiers, but retrieval is often inexpensive. \\nQuery results cache is another example of hot data. When a query is run, some query \\nengines will persist the query results in the cache. For a limited time, when the same \\nquery is run, instead of rerunning the same query against storage, the query results \\ncache serves the cached results. This allows for much faster query response times \\nversus redundantly issuing the same query repeatedly. In upcoming chapters, we cover \\nquery results caches in more detail. \\nWarm data.    Warm data is accessed semi-regularly, say, once per month. No hard \\nand fast rules indicate how often warm data is accessed, but it’s less than hot data and \\nmore than cold data. The major cloud providers offer object storage tiers that \\naccommodate warm data. For exa mple, S3 offers an Infrequently Accessed Tier, and \\nGoogle Cloud has a similar storage tier called Nearline.

Though storing cold data \\nis cheap, retrieving cold data is often expensive. \\nStorage tier considerations.    When considering the storage tier for your data, \\nconsider the costs of each tier. If you store all of your data in hot storage, all of the data \\ncan be accessed quickly. But this comes at a tremendous price! Conversely, if you store \\nall data in cold storage to save on costs, you’ll certainly lower your storage costs, but \\nat the expense of prolonged retrieval times and high retrieval costs if you need to access \\ndata. The storage price goes down from faster/higher performing sto rage to lower \\nstorage. \\nCold storage is popular for archiving data. Historically, cold storage involved physical \\nbackups and often mailing this data to a third party that would archive it in a literal \\nvault. Cold storage is increasingly popular in the cloud. Every cloud vendor of fers a \\ncold data solution, and you should weigh the cost of pushing data into cold storage \\nversus the cost and time to retrieve the data. \\nData engineers need to account for spillover from hot to warm/cold storage. Memory \\nis expensive and finite. For example, if hot data is stored in memory, it can be spilled \\nto disk when there’s too much new data to store and not enough memory. Some \\ndatabases may move infrequently accessed data to warm or cold tiers, offloading the \\ndata to either HDD or object storage. The latter is increasingly more common because \\nof the cost-effectiveness of object storage. If you’re in the cloud and using managed \\nservices, disk spillover will happen automatically. \\nIf you’re using cloud-based object storage, create automated lifecycle policies for your \\ndata. This will drastically reduce your storage costs. For example, if your data needs \\nto be accessed only once a month, move the data to an infrequent access storage tier. \\nIf your data is 180 days old and not accessed for current queries, move it to an archival \\nstorage tier. In both cases, you can automate the migration of data away from regular \\nobject storage, and you’ll save money. That said, consider the retrieval costs—both in \\ntime and money—using infrequent or archival style storage tiers. Access and retrieval \\ntimes and costs may vary depending on the cloud provider.

Here are some things to think about with data retention. \\nValue.    Data is an asset, so you should know the value of the data you’re storing. Of \\ncourse, value is subjective and depends on what it’s worth to your immediate use case \\nand your broader organization. Is this data impossible to re -create, or can it easily be \\nre-created by querying upstream systems? What’s the impact to downstream users if \\nthis data is available versus if it is not? \\nTime.    The value to downstream users also depends upon the age of the data. New \\ndata is typically more valuable and frequently accessed than older data. Technical \\nlimitations may determine how long you can store data in certain storage tiers. For \\nexample, if you store hot data in cache or memory, you’ll likely need to set a time to \\nlive (TTL), so you can expire data after a certain point or persist it to warm or cold \\nstorage. Otherwise, your hot storage will become full, and queries against the hot data \\nwill suffer from performance lags. \\nCompliance.    Certain regulations (e.g., HIPAA and Payment Card Industry, or PCI) \\nmight require you to keep data for a certain time. In these situations, the data simply \\nneeds to be accessible upon request, even if the likelihood of an access request is low. \\nOther regulations might require you to hold data for only a limited period of time, and \\nyou’ll need to have the ability to delete specific information on time and within \\ncompliance guidelines. You’ll need a storage and archival data process —along with \\nthe ability to search the data —that fits the retention requirements of the particular \\nregulation with which you need to comply. Of course, you’ll want to balance \\ncompliance against cost. \\nCost.    Data is an asset that (hopefully) has an ROI. On the cost side of ROI, an obvious \\nstorage expense is associated with data. Consider the timeline in which you need to \\nretain data. Given our discussion about hot, warm, and cold data, implement automatic \\ndata lifecycle management practices and move the data to cold storage if you don’t \\nneed the data past the required retention date. Or delete data if it’s truly not needed. \\nSingle-Tenant Versus Multitenant Storage \\nIn Chapter 3 , we covered the trade -offs between single -tenant and multitenant \\narchitecture. To recap, with single-tenant architecture, each group of tenants (e.g., \\nindividual users, groups of users, accounts, or customers) gets its own dedicated set of \\nresources such as networking, compute, and storage.

First, \\nthe code you write should perform well with your storage system. Make sure the code \\nyou write stores the data correctly and doesn’t accidentally cause data, memory leaks, \\nor performance issues. Second, define your storage infrastructure as code and use \\nephemeral compute resources when it’s time to process your data. Because storage is \\nincreasingly distinct from compute, you can automatically spin resources up and down \\nwhile keeping your data in object storage. This keeps your infrastructure clean and \\navoids coupling your storage and query layers. \\nConclusion \\nStorage is everywhere and underlays many stages of the data engineering lifecycle.

In the data engineering space, a good \\ndeal of ceremony occurs around data movement and processing patterns, with \\nestablished patterns such as ETL, newer patterns such as ELT, and new names for long-\\nestablished practices (reverse ETL) and data sharing. \\nAll of these concepts are encompassed in the idea of a data pipeline. It is essential to \\nunderstand the details of these various patterns and know that a modern data pipeline \\nincludes all of them. As the world moves away from a traditional monolithic approach \\nwith rigid constraints on data movement, and toward an open ecos ystem of cloud \\nservices that are assembled like LEGO bricks to realize products, data engineers \\nprioritize using the right tools to accomplish the desired outcome over adhering to a \\nnarrow philosophy of data movement. \\nIn general, here’s our definition of a data pipeline: \\nA data pipeline is the combination of architecture, systems, and processes that move data \\nthrough the stages of the data engineering lifecycle. \\nOur definition is deliberately fluid—and intentionally vague—to allow data engineers \\nto plug in whatever they need to accomplish the task at hand. A data pipeline could be \\na traditional ETL system, where data is ingested from an on -premises transactional \\nsystem, passed through a monolithic processor, and written into a data warehouse. Or \\nit could be a cloud -based data pipeline that pulls data from 100 sources, combines it \\ninto 20 wide tables, trains five other ML models, deploys them into production, and \\nmonitors ongoing performance. A data pipeline should be flexible enough to fit any \\nneeds along the data engineering lifecycle. \\nLet’s keep this notion of data pipelines in mind as we proceed through this chapter. \\nKey Engineering Considerations for the \\nIngestion Phase \\nWhen preparing to architect or build an ingestion system, here are some primary \\nconsiderations and questions to ask yourself related to data ingestion: \\n• What’s the use case for the data I’m ingesting? \\n• Can I reuse this data and avoid ingesting multiple versions of the same dataset? \\n• Where is the data going?

Bounded data is a convenient way \\nof bucketing data across some sort of boundary, such as time.'),\n",

The grocery list that I scribbled \\nthis afternoon is bounded data. I wrote it as a stream of consciousness (unbounded \\ndata) onto a piece of scrap paper, where the thoughts now exist as  a list of things \\n(bounded data) I need to buy at the grocery store.

On the slow \\nend, a business might ship its tax data to an accounting firm once a year. On the faster \\nside, a CDC system could retrieve new log updates from a source database once a \\nminute. Even faster, a system might continuously ingest events from IoT sensors and \\nprocess these within seconds. Data -ingestion frequencies are often mixed in a \\ncompany, depending on the use case and technologies. \\n \\nFigure 7-4. The spectrum batch to real-time ingestion frequencies \\nWe note that “real -time” ingestion patterns are becoming increasingly common. We \\nput “real-time” in quotation marks because no ingestion system is genuinely real-time. \\nAny database, queue or pipeline has inherent latency in delivering data to a target \\nsystem. It is more accurate to speak of near real-time, but we often use real-time for \\nbrevity. The near real -time pattern generally does away with an explicit update \\nfrequency; events are processed in the pipeline either one by one as they arrive or in \\nmicro-batches (i.e., batches over concise time intervals). For this book, we will use \\nreal-time and streaming interchangeably. \\nEven with a streaming data -ingestion process, batch processing downstream is \\nrelatively standard. At the time of this writing, ML models are typically trained on a \\nbatch basis, although continuous online training is becoming more prevalent. Rarely \\ndo data engineers have the option to build a purely near real -time pipeline with no \\nbatch components. Instead, they choose where batch boundaries will occur —i.e., the \\ndata engineering lifecycle data will be broken into batches. Once data reaches a batch \\nprocess, the batch frequency becomes a bottleneck for all downstream processing. \\nIn addition, streaming systems are the best fit for many data source types. In IoT \\napplications, the typical pattern is for each sensor to write events or measurements to \\nstreaming systems as they happen. While this data can be written directly into a \\ndatabase, a streaming ingestion platform such as Amazon Kinesis or Apache Kafka is \\na better fit for the application. Software applications can adopt similar patterns by \\nwriting events to a message queue as they happen rather than waiting for an extraction \\nprocess to pull events and state information from a backend database.

As you can see in Figure 7-5, each stage of the \\ndata engineering lifecycle has processes A, B, and C directly dependent upon one \\nanother. If process A fails, processes B and C cannot start; if process B fails, process \\nC doesn’t start. This type of synchronous workflow is common in older ETL systems, \\nwhere data extracted from a source system must then be transformed before being \\nloaded into a data warehouse. Processes downstream of ingestion can’t start until all \\ndata in the batch has been ingested. If the ingestion or transformation process fails, the \\nentire process must be rerun. \\n \\nFigure 7-5. A synchronous ingestion process runs as discrete batch steps \\nHere’s a mini case study of how not to design your data pipelines. At one company, the \\ntransformation process itself was a series of dozens of tightly coupled synchronous \\nworkflows, with the entire process taking over 24 hours to finish. If any step of that \\ntransformation pipeline failed, t he whole transformation process had to be restarted \\nfrom the beginning! In this instance, we saw process after process fail, and because of \\nnonexistent or cryptic error messages, fixing the pipeline was a game of whack-a-mole \\nthat took over a week to diagnose and cure. Meanwhile, the business didn’t have \\nupdated reports during that time. People weren’t happy. \\nWith asynchronous ingestion, dependencies can now operate at the level of individual \\nevents, much as they would in a software backend built from microservices (Figure 7-\\n6). Individual events become available in storage as soon as they are ingested \\nindividually. Take the example of a web application on AWS that emits events into \\nAmazon Kinesis Data Streams (here acting as a buffer). The stream is read by Apache \\nBeam, which parses and enriches events, and then forwards them to a second Kinesis \\nstream; Kinesis Data Firehose rolls up events and writes objects to Amazon S3. \\n \\nFigure 7-6.

The processing rate depends on available \\nresources. The Kinesis Data Stream acts as the shock absorber, moderating the load so \\nthat event rate spikes will not overwhelm downstream processing. Events will move \\nthrough the pipeline quickly when the event rate is low, and any backlog has cleared. \\nNote that we could modify the scenario and use a Kinesis Data Stream for storage, \\neventually extracting events to S3 before they expire out of the stream. \\nSerialization and Deserialization \\nMoving data from source to destination involves serialization and deserialization. As a \\nreminder, serialization means encoding the data from a source and preparing data \\nstructures for transmission and intermediate storage stages. \\nWhen ingesting data, ensure that your destination can deserialize the data it receives. \\nWe’ve seen data ingested from a source but then sitting inert and unusable in the \\ndestination because the data cannot be properly deserialized. See the more extensive \\ndiscussion of serialization in Appendix A. \\nThroughput and Scalability \\nIn theory, your ingestion should never be a bottleneck. In practice, ingestion \\nbottlenecks are pretty standard. Data throughput and system scalability become critical \\nas your data volumes grow and requirements change. Design your systems to scale and \\nshrink to flexibly match the desired data throughput. \\nWhere you’re ingesting data from matters a lot. If you’re receiving data as it’s \\ngenerated, will the upstream system have any issues that might impact your \\ndownstream ingestion pipelines? For example, suppose a source database goes down. \\nWhen it comes back  online and attempts to backfill the lapsed data loads, will your \\ningestion be able to keep up with this sudden influx of backlogged data? \\nAnother thing to consider is your ability to handle bursty data ingestion. Data \\ngeneration rarely happens at a constant rate and often ebbs and flows. Built -in \\nbuffering is required to collect events during rate spikes to prevent data from getting \\nlost. Buffering bridges the time while the system scales and allows storage systems to \\naccommodate bursts even in a dynamically scalable system. \\nWhenever possible, use managed services that handle the throughput scaling for you. \\nWhile you can manually accomplish these tasks by adding more servers, shards, or \\nworkers, often this isn’t value -added work, and there’s a good chance you’ll miss \\nsomething. Much of this heavy lifting is now automated. Don’t reinvent the data \\ningestion wheel if you don’t have to.'),\n",

Reliability \\nentails high uptime and proper failover for ingestion systems. Durability entails \\nmaking sure that data isn’t lost or corrupted. \\nSome data sources (e.g., IoT devices and caches) may not retain data if it is not \\ncorrectly ingested. Once lost, it is gone for good. In this sense, the reliability of \\ningestion systems leads directly to the durability of generated data. If data is ingested, \\ndownstream processes can theoretically run late if they break temporarily. \\nOur advice is to evaluate the risks and build an appropriate level of redundancy and \\nself-healing based on the impact and cost of losing data. Reliability and durability have \\nboth direct and indirect costs. For example, will your ingestion process continue if an \\nAWS zone goes down? How about a whole region? How about the power grid or the \\ninternet? Of course, nothing is free. How much will this cost you? You might be able \\nto build a highly redundant system and have a team on call 24 hours a day to handle \\noutages. This also means your cloud and labor costs become prohibitive (direct costs), \\nand the ongoing work takes a significant toll on your team (indirect costs). There’s no \\nsingle correct answer, and you need to evaluate the costs and benefits of your reliability \\nand durability decisions. \\nDon’t assume that you can build a system that will reliably and durably ingest data in \\nevery possible scenario. Even the nearly infinite budget of the US federal government \\ncan’t guarantee this. In many extreme scenarios, ingesting data actually won’t matter. \\nThere will be little to ingest if the internet goes down, even if you build multiple \\nairgapped data centers in underground bunkers with independent power. Continually \\nevaluate the trade-offs and costs of reliability and durability. \\nPayload \\nA payload is the dataset you’re ingesting and has characteristics such as kind, shape, \\nsize, schema and data types, and metadata. Let’s look at some of these characteristics \\nto understand why this matters. \\nKind \\nThe kind of data you handle directly impacts how it’s dealt with downstream in the \\ndata engineering lifecycle. Kind consists of type and format. Data has a type—tabular, \\nimage, video, text, etc. The type directly influences the data format or the way it is \\nexpressed in bytes, names, and file extensions. For example, a tabular kind of data may \\nbe in formats such as CSV or Parquet, with each of these formats having different byte \\npatterns for serialization and deserialization.

The problem has been somewhat exacerbated by \\nthe popularity of object -relational mapping (ORM), which automatically generates \\nschemas based on object structure in languages such as Java or Python.

With full snapshots, engineers \\ngrab the entire current state of the source system on each update read. With the \\ndifferential update pattern, engineers can pull only the updates and changes since the \\nlast read from the source system. While differential updates are ideal for minimizing \\nnetwork traffic and target storage usage, full snapshot reads remain extremely common \\nbecause of their simplicity. \\nFile-Based Export and Ingestion \\nData is quite often moved between databases and systems using files. Data is serialized \\ninto files in an exchangeable format, and these files are provided to an ingestion \\nsystem. We consider file -based export to be a push-based ingestion pattern. This is \\nbecause data export and preparation work is done on the source system side. \\nFile-based ingestion has several potential advantages over a direct database connection \\napproach. It is often undesirable to allow direct access to backend systems for security \\nreasons. With file-based ingestion, export processes are run on the data -source side, \\ngiving source system engineers complete control over what data gets exported and how \\nthe data is preprocessed. Once files are done, they can be provided to the target system \\nin various ways. Common file -exchange methods are object storage, secure fi le \\ntransfer protocol (SFTP), electronic data interchange (EDI), \\nor secure copy (SCP). \\nETL Versus ELT \\nChapter 3 introduced ETL and ELT, both extremely common ingestion, storage, and \\ntransformation patterns you’ll encounter in batch workloads. The following are brief \\ndefinitions of the extract and load parts of ETL and ELT: \\nExtract \\nThis means getting data from a source system. While extract seems to imply \\npulling data, it can also be push based. Extraction may also require reading \\nmetadata and schema changes. \\nLoad \\nOnce data is extracted, it can either be transformed (ETL) before loading it into a \\nstorage destination or simply loaded into storage for future transformation. When \\nloading data, you should be mindful of the type of system you’re loading, the \\nschema of the data, and the performance impact of loading. \\nWe cover ETL and ELT in greater detail in Chapter 8.'),\n",

For example, \\nwhile it is common to insert one row at a time in a transactional database, this is a bad \\npattern for many columnar databases, as it forces the creation of many small, \\nsuboptimal files and forces the system to run a high number of create object operations. \\nRunning many small in-place update operations is an even bigger problem because it \\ncauses the database to scan each existing column file to run the update. \\nUnderstand the appropriate update patterns for the database or data store you’re \\nworking with. Also, understand that certain technologies are purpose -built for high \\ninsert rates.

Know the limits \\nand characteristics of your tools. \\nData Migration \\nMigrating data to a new database or environment is not usually trivial, and data needs \\nto be moved in bulk. Sometimes this means moving data sizes that are hundreds of \\nterabytes or much larger, often involving the migration of specific tables and moving \\nentire databases and systems. \\nData migrations probably aren’t a regular occurrence as a data engineer, but you should \\nbe familiar with them. As is often the case for data ingestion, schema management is \\na crucial consideration. Suppose you’re migrating data from one database system to a \\ndifferent one (say, SQL Server to Snowflake). No matter how closely the two databases \\nresemble each other, subtle differences almost always exist in the way they handle \\nschema. Fortunately, it is generally easy to test ingestion of a sample of data and find \\nschema issues before undertaking a complete table migration. \\nMost data systems perform best when data is moved in bulk rather than as individual \\nrows or events. File or object storage is often an excellent intermediate stage for \\ntransferring data. Also, one of the biggest challenges of database migration is not the \\nmovement of the data itself but the movement of data pipeline connections from the \\nold system to the new one. \\nBe aware that many tools are available to automate various types of data migrations. \\nEspecially for large and complex migrations, we suggest looking at these options \\nbefore doing this manually or writing your own migration solution.'),\n",

This section covers issues you should consider when \\ningesting events, drawing on topics covered in Chapters 5 and 6. \\nSchema Evolution \\nSchema evolution is common when handling event data; fields may be added or \\nremoved, or value types might change (say, a string to an integer). Schema evolution \\ncan have unintended impacts on your data pipelines and destinations. For example, an \\nIoT device gets a firmware update that adds a new field to the event it transmits, or a \\nthird-party API introduces changes to its event payload or countless other scenarios. \\nAll of these potentially impact your downstream capabilities. \\nTo alleviate issues related to schema evolution, here are a few suggestions. First, if \\nyour event -processing framework has a schema registry (discussed earlier in this \\nchapter), use it to version your schema changes. Next, a dead -letter queue (described \\nin “Error Handling and Dead -Letter Queues” on page 249 ) can help you investigate \\nissues with events that are not properly handled. Finally, the low-fidelity route (and the \\nmost effective) is regularly communicating with upstream stakeholders about potential \\nschema changes and proactively addressing schema changes with the teams \\nintroducing these changes instead of reacting to the receiving end of breaking changes. \\nLate-Arriving Data \\nThough you probably prefer all event data to arrive on time, event data might arrive \\nlate. A group of events might occur around the same time frame (similar event times), \\nbut some might arrive later than others (late ingestion times) because of various \\ncircumstances. \\nFor example, an IoT device might be late sending a message because of internet latency \\nissues. This is common when ingesting data. You should be aware of latearriving data \\nand the impact on downstream systems and uses. Suppose you assume that ingestion \\nor process time is the same as the event time. You may get some strange results if your \\nreports or analysis depend on an accurate portrayal of when events occur.

Replay is a key capability in \\nmany streaming ingestion platforms and is particularly useful when you need to \\nreingest and reprocess data for a specific time range. For example, RabbitMQ typically \\ndeletes messages after all subscribers consume them. Kafka, Kinesis, and Pub/Sub all \\nsupport event retention and replay. \\nTime to Live \\nHow long will you preserve your event record? A key parameter is maximum message \\nretention time, also known as the time to live (TTL). TTL is usually a configuration \\nyou’ll set for how long you want events to live before they are acknowledged and \\ningested. Any unacknowledged event that’s not ingested after its TTL expires \\nautomatically disappears. This is helpful to reduce backpressure and unnecessary event \\nvolume in your event-ingestion pipeline. \\nFind the right balance of TTL impact on our data pipeline. An extremely short TTL \\n(milliseconds or seconds) might cause most messages to disappear before processing. \\nA very long TTL (several weeks or months) will create a backlog of many unprocessed \\nmessages, resulting in long wait times. \\nLet’s look at how some popular platforms handle TTL at the time of this writing. \\nGoogle Cloud Pub/Sub supports retention periods of up to 7 days. Amazon Kinesis \\nData Streams retention can be turned up to 365 days. Kafka can be configured for \\nindefinite retention, limited by available disk space.

Most commonly, this connection is made using ODBC or JDBC. \\nODBC uses a driver hosted by a client accessing the database to translate commands \\nissued to the standard ODBC API into commands issued to the database. The database \\nreturns query results over the wire, where the driver receives them and translates them \\nback into a standard form to be read by the client. For ingestion, the application \\nutilizing the ODBC driver is an ingestion tool. The ingestion tool may pull data through \\nmany small queries or a single large query. \\nJDBC is conceptually remarkably similar to ODBC. A Java driver connects to a remote \\ndatabase and serves as a translation layer between the standard JDBC API and the \\nnative network interface of the target database. It might seem strange to have a database \\nAPI dedicated to a single programming language, but there are strong motivations for \\nthis. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) is standard, portable across hardware \\narchitectures and operating systems, and provides the performance of compiled code \\nthrough a just-in-time (JIT) compiler. The JVM is an extremely popular compiling VM \\nfor running code in a portable manner. \\nJDBC provides extraordinary database driver portability. ODBC drivers are shipped as \\nOS and architecture native binaries; database vendors must maintain versions for each \\narchitecture/OS version that they wish to support. On the other hand, vendors can ship \\na single JDBC driver that is compatible with any JVM language (e.g., Java, Scala, \\nClojure, or Kotlin) and JVM data framework (i.e., Spark.) JDBC has become so \\npopular that it is also used as an interface for non-JVM languages such as Python; the \\nPython ecosystem provides translation tools that allow Python code to talk to a JDBC \\ndriver running on a local JVM. \\nJDBC and ODBC are used extensively for data ingestion from relational databases, \\nreturning to the general concept of direct database connections. Various enhancements \\nare used to accelerate data ingestion. Many data frameworks can parallelize several \\nsimultaneous connections and partition queries to pull data in parallel.

Alternatively, many cloud data warehouses \\nprovide direct REST APIs. \\nJDBC connections should generally be integrated with other ingestion technologies. \\nFor example, we commonly use a reader process to connect to a database with JDBC, \\nwrite the extracted data into multiple objects, and then orchestrate ingestion into a \\ndownstream system (see Figure 7 -13). The reader process can run in a wholly \\nephemeral cloud instance or in an orchestration system. \\n \\nFigure 7-13.

We set the filter timestamp based on when we last captured changed \\nrows from the tables. This process allows us to pull changes and differentially update \\na target table. \\nThis form of batch-oriented CDC has a key limitation: while we can easily determine \\nwhich rows have changed since a point in time, we don’t necessarily obtain all changes \\nthat were applied to these rows.

When money is moved in and out of accounts, the banking \\napplication runs a transaction to update the balance. \\nWhen we run a query to return all rows in the account table that changed in the last 24 \\nhours, we’ll see records for each account that recorded a transaction. Suppose that a \\ncertain customer withdrew money five times using a debit card in the last 24 hours . \\nOur query will return only the last account balance recorded in the 24 hour period; \\nother records over the period won’t appear. This issue can be mitigated by utilizing an \\ninsert-only schema, where each account transaction is recorded as a new record in the \\ntable (see “Insert-Only” on page 162). \\nContinuous CDC \\nContinuous CDC  captures all table history and can support near real -time data \\ningestion, either for real -time database replication or to feed real -time streaming \\nanalytics. Rather than running periodic queries to get a batch of table changes, \\ncontinuous CDC treats each write to the database as an event. \\nWe can capture an event stream for continuous CDC in a couple of ways. One of the \\nmost common approaches with a transactional database such as PostgreSQL is log-\\nbased CDC. The database binary log records every change to the database sequentially \\n(see “Database Logs” on page 161). A CDC tool can read this log and send the events \\nto a target, such as the Apache Kafka Debezium streaming platform. \\nSome databases support a simplified, managed CDC paradigm. For instance, many \\ncloud-hosted databases can be configured to directly trigger a serverless function or \\nwrite to an event stream every time a change happens in the database. This completely \\nfrees engineers from worrying about the details of how events are captured in the \\ndatabase and forwarded. \\nCDC and database replication \\nCDC can be used to replicate between databases: events are buffered into a stream and \\nasynchronously written into a second database. However, many databases natively \\nsupport a tightly coupled version of replication (synchronous replication) that keeps \\nthe replica fully in sync with the primary database. Synchronous replication typically \\nrequires that the  primary database and the replica are of the same type (e.g., \\nPostgreSQL to PostgreSQL). The advantage of synchronous replication is that the \\nsecondary database can offload work from the primary database by acting as a read \\nreplica; read queries can be redirected to the replica. The query will return the same \\nresults that would be returned from the primary database. \\nRead replicas are often used in batch data ingestion patterns to allow large scans to run \\nwithout overloading the primary production database.

This makes object storage ideal for moving data in and out of data \\nlakes, between teams, and transferring data between organizations. You can even \\nprovide short-term access to an object with a signed URL, giving a user temporary \\npermission. \\nIn our view, object storage is the most optimal and secure way to handle file exchange. \\nPublic cloud storage implements the latest security standards, has a robust track record \\nof scalability and reliability, accepts files of arbitrary types and sizes, and  provides \\nhigh-performance data movement. We discussed object storage much more extensively \\nin Chapter 6. \\nEDI \\nAnother practical reality for data engineers is electronic data interchange (EDI). The \\nterm is vague enough to refer to any data movement method. It usually refers to \\nsomewhat archaic means of file exchange, such as by email or flash drive. Data \\nengineers will find that some data sources do not support more modern means of data \\ntransport, often because of archaic IT systems or human process limitations. \\nEngineers can at least enhance EDI through automation. For example, they can set up \\na cloud-based email server that saves files onto company object storage as soon as they \\nare received. This can trigger orchestration processes to ingest and process data. This \\nis much more robust than an employee downloading the attached file and manually \\nuploading it to an internal system, which we still frequently see. \\nDatabases and File Export \\nEngineers should be aware of how the source database systems handle file export. \\nExport involves large data scans that significantly load the database for many \\ntransactional systems. Source system engineers must assess when these scans can be \\nrun without affecting application performance and might opt for a strategy to mitigate \\nthe load. Export queries can be broken into smaller exports by querying over key'),\n",

Alternatively, a read replica can reduce load. Read \\nreplicas are especially appropriate if exports happen many times a day and coincide \\nwith a high source system load. \\nMajor cloud data warehouses are highly optimized for direct file export. For example, \\nSnowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, and others support direct export to object storage in \\nvarious formats. \\nPractical Issues with Common File Formats \\nEngineers should also be aware of the file formats to export. CSV is still ubiquitous \\nand highly error prone at the time of this writing. Namely, CSV’s default delimiter is \\nalso one of the most familiar characters in the English language —the comma! But it \\ngets worse. \\nCSV is by no means a uniform format. Engineers must stipulate the delimiter, quote \\ncharacters, and escaping to appropriately handle the export of string data. CSV also \\ndoesn’t natively encode schema information or directly support nested structures. CSV \\nfile encoding and schema information must be configured in the target system to ensure \\nappropriate ingestion. Autodetection is a convenience feature provided in many cloud \\nenvironments but is inappropriate for production ingestion. As a best practice, \\nengineers should record CSV encoding and schema details in file metadata. \\nMore robust and expressive export formats include Parquet, Avro, Arrow, and ORC or \\nJSON. These formats natively encode schema information and handle arbitrary string \\ndata with no particular intervention. Many of them also handle nested data structures \\nnatively so that JSON fields are stored using internal nested structures rather than \\nsimple strings. For columnar databases, columnar formats (Parquet, Arrow, ORC) \\nallow more efficient data export because columns can be directly transcoded between \\nformats. These formats are also generally more optimized for query engines. The \\nArrow file format i s designed to map data directly into processing engine memory, \\nproviding high performance in data lake environments. \\nThe disadvantage of these newer formats is that many of them are not natively \\nsupported by source systems. Data engineers are often forced to work with CSV data \\nand then build robust exception handling and error detection to ensure data quality on \\ningestion. See Appendix A for a more extensive discussion of file formats. \\nShell \\nThe shell is an interface by which you may execute commands to ingest data. The shell \\ncan be used to script workflows for virtually any software tool, and shell scripting is \\nstill used extensively in ingestion processes. A shell script might read data from a \\ndatabase, reserialize it into a different file format, upload it to object storage, and'),\n",

While storing data on a single instance \\nor server is not highly scalable, many of our data sources are not particularly large, and \\nsuch approaches work just fine. \\nIn addition, cloud vendors generally provide robust CLI -based tools. It is possible to \\nrun complex ingestion processes simply by issuing commands to the AWS CLI. As \\ningestion processes grow more complicated and the SLA grows more stringent, \\nengineers should consider moving to a proper orchestration system. \\nSSH \\nSSH is not an ingestion strategy but a protocol used with other ingestion strategies. We \\nuse SSH in a few ways. First, SSH can be used for file transfer with SCP, as mentioned \\nearlier. Second, SSH tunnels are used to allow secure, isolated connections to \\ndatabases. \\nApplication databases should never be directly exposed on the internet. Instead, \\nengineers can set up a bastion host—i.e., an intermediate host instance that can connect \\nto the database in question. This host machine is exposed on the internet, although \\nlocked down for minimal access from only specified IP addresses to specified ports. \\nTo connect to the database, a remote machine first opens an SSH tunnel connection to \\nthe bastion host and then connects from the host machine to the database. \\nSFTP and SCP \\nAccessing and sending data both from secure FTP (SFTP) and secure copy (SCP) are \\ntechniques you should be familiar with, even if data engineers do not typically use \\nthese regularly (IT or security/secOps will handle this). \\nEngineers rightfully cringe at the mention of SFTP (occasionally, we even hear \\ninstances of FTP being used in production). Regardless, SFTP is still a practical reality \\nfor many businesses. They work with partner businesses that consume or provide data \\nusing SFTP and are unwilling to rely on other standards. To avoid data leaks, security \\nanalysis is critical in these situations. \\nSCP is a file-exchange protocol that runs over an SSH connection. SCP can be a secure \\nfile-transfer option if it is configured correctly. Again, adding additional network \\naccess control (defense in depth) to enhance SCP security is highly recommended. \\nWebhooks \\nWebhooks, as we discussed in Chapter 5, are often referred to as reverse APIs. For a \\ntypical REST data API, the data provider gives engineers API specifications that they \\nuse to write their data ingestion code. The code makes requests and receives data in \\nresponses.'),\n",

A basic webhook ingestion architecture built from cloud services \\nWebhook-based data ingestion architectures can be brittle, difficult to maintain, and \\ninefficient. Using appropriate off-the-shelf tools, data engineers can build more robust \\nwebhook architectures with lower maintenance and infrastructure costs. For example, \\na webhook pattern in AWS might use a serverless function framework (Lambda) to \\nreceive incoming events, a managed event -streaming platform to store and buffer \\nmessages (Kinesis), a stream -processing framework to handle real -time analytics \\n(Flink), and an object store for long-term storage (S3). \\nYou’ll notice that this architecture does much more than simply ingest the data. This \\nunderscores ingestion’s entanglement with the other stages of the data engineering \\nlifecycle; it is often impossible to define your ingestion architecture without making \\ndecisions about storage and processing. \\nWeb Interface \\nWeb interfaces for data access remain a practical reality for data engineers. We \\nfrequently run into situations where not all data and functionality in a SaaS platform is \\nexposed through automated interfaces such as APIs and file drops. Instead, someone \\nmust manually access a web interface, generate a report, and download a file to a local \\nmachine. This has obvious drawbacks, such as people forgetting to run the report or \\nhaving their laptop die. Where possible, choose tools and workflows that allow for \\nautomated access to data. \\nWeb Scraping \\nWeb scraping automatically extracts data from web pages, often by combing the web \\npage’s various HTML elements.

It’s also a murky \\narea where ethical and legal lines are blurry. \\nHere is some top -level advice to be aware of before undertaking any web -scraping \\nproject. First, ask yourself if you should be web scraping or if data is available from a \\nthird party. If your decision is to web scrape, be a good citizen. Don’t inadvertentl y \\ncreate a denial -of-service (DoS) attack, and don’t get your IP address blocked. \\nUnderstand how much traffic you generate and pace your web -crawling activities \\nappropriately. Just because you can spin up thousands of simultaneous Lambda \\nfunctions to scrape doesn’t mean you should; excessive web scraping could lead to the \\ndisabling of your AWS account. \\nSecond, be aware of the legal implications of your activities. Again, generating DoS \\nattacks can entail legal consequences. Actions that violate terms of service may cause \\nheadaches for your employer or you personally. \\nThird, web pages constantly change their HTML element structure, making it tricky to \\nkeep your web scraper updated. Ask yourself, is the headache of maintaining these \\nsystems worth the effort? \\nWeb scraping has interesting implications for the data engineering lifecycle processing \\nstage; engineers should think about various factors at the beginning of a webscraping \\nproject. What do you intend to do with the data? Are you just pulling required fie lds \\nfrom the scraped HTML by using Python code and then writing these values to a \\ndatabase? Do you intend to maintain the complete HTML code of the scraped websites \\nand process this data using a framework like Spark? These decisions may lead to very \\ndifferent architectures downstream of ingestion. \\nTransfer Appliances for Data Migration \\nFor massive quantities of data (100 TB or more), transferring data directly over the \\ninternet may be a slow and costly process. At this scale, the fastest, most efficient way \\nto move data is not over the wire but by truck. Cloud vendors offer the ability to send \\nyour data via a physical “box of hard drives.” Simply order a storage device, called a \\ntransfer appliance, load your data from your servers, and then send it back to the cloud \\nvendor, which will upload your data. \\nThe suggestion is to consider using a transfer appliance if your data size hovers around \\n100 TB. On the extreme end, AWS even offers Snowmobile, a transfer appliance sent \\nto you in a semitrailer! Snowmobile is intended to lift and shift an entire data center, \\nin which data sizes are in the petabytes or greater. \\nTransfer appliances are handy for creating hybrid -cloud or multicloud setups. For \\nexample, Amazon’s data transfer appliance (AWS Snowball) supports import and \\nexport. To migrate into a second cloud, users can export their data into a Snowball'),\n",

This might sound awkward, but even when it’s feasible to push data over the \\ninternet between clouds, data egress fees make this a costly proposition. Physical \\ntransfer appliances are a cheaper alternative when the data volumes are significant. \\nRemember that transfer appliances and data migration services are one -time data \\ningestion events and are not suggested for ongoing workloads. Suppose you have \\nworkloads requiring constant data movement in either a hybrid or multicloud scenario. \\nIn that case, your data sizes are presumably batching or streaming much smaller data \\nsizes on an ongoing basis. \\nData Sharing \\nData sharing is growing as a popular option for consuming data (see Chapters 5 and \\n6). Data providers will offer datasets to third -party subscribers, either for free or at a \\ncost. These datasets are often shared in a read-only fashion, meaning you can integrate \\nthese datasets with your own data (and other third-party datasets), but you do not own \\nthe shared dataset. In the strict sense, this isn’t ingestion, where you get physical \\npossession of the dataset. If the data provider decides to remove your access  to a \\ndataset, you’ll no longer have access to it. \\nMany cloud platforms offer data sharing, allowing you to share your data and consume \\ndata from various providers. Some of these platforms also provide data marketplaces \\nwhere companies and organizations can offer their data for sale. \\nWhom You’ll Work With \\nData ingestion sits at several organizational boundaries. In developing and managing \\ndata ingestion pipelines, data engineers will work with both people and systems sitting \\nupstream (data producers) and downstream (data consumers). \\nUpstream Stakeholders \\nA significant disconnect often exists between those responsible for generating data —\\ntypically, software engineers—and the data engineers who will prepare this data for \\nanalytics and data science. Software engineers and data engineers usually sit in \\nseparate organizational silos; if they think about data engineers, they typically see them \\nsimply as downstream consumers of the data exhaust from their application, not as \\nstakeholders. \\nWe see this current state of affairs as a problem and a significant opportunity.

      "## 2. Core Feature Set\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.1 Observability (Tracing & Logging)\n",
      "\n",
      "| Feature | What it does | Why it matters |\n",
      "|---------|--------------|----------------|\n",
      "| **Request tracing** | Every LLM call (prompt, model, parameters, response) is automatically recorded as a “trace”. | Gives you a complete audit trail to reproduce bugs or understand model behavior. |\n",
      "| **Metadata capture** | You can attach custom tags (e.g., user ID, experiment name, environment) to each trace. | Enables powerful filtering, cost‑analysis, and downstream analytics. |\n",
      "| **Dashboard & UI** | Visual timeline of each trace, showing prompt, model output, latency, token usage, and any downstream code execution. | Quickly spot slow steps, hallucinations, or token‑budget overruns. |\n",
      "| **Alerting & notifications** | Set thresholds on latency, error rates, or custom metrics; receive Slack/Email/webhook alerts. | Prevents production incidents from slipping through. |\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.2 Prompt Engineering & Testing (Prompt Studio)\n",
      "\n",
      "| Feature | What it does | Why it matters |\n",
      "|---------|--------------|----------------|\n",
      "| **Prompt versioning** | Every edit creates a new version that can be compared side‑by‑side. | Guarantees reproducibility and lets you roll back to a known‑good version. |\n",
      "| **Collaborative editing** | Teams can comment, suggest changes, and approve prompts directly in the UI. | Reduces hand‑off friction between data scientists and product managers. |\n",
      "| **Prompt testing sandbox** | Run a prompt against a set of test inputs, see the model’s responses, and capture metrics (accuracy, toxicity, etc.). | Enables rapid iteration before code deployment. |\n",
      "| **A/B testing** | Deploy two prompt versions simultaneously and compare performance on live traffic. | Empirical evidence for choosing the best prompt. |\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.3 Evaluation & Metrics\n",
      "\n",
      "| Feature | What it does | Why it matters |\n",
      "|---------|--------------|----------------|\n",
      "| **Built‑in evaluators** | Common metrics (BLEU, ROUGE, exact match, semantic similarity, factuality, toxicity, cost). | Gives you a quantitative view of output quality. |\n",
      "| **Custom evaluators** | Upload a Python function that receives a trace and returns a score; can be stored in the platform. | Supports domain‑specific criteria (e.g., legal compliance, business KPIs). |\n",
      "| **Batch evaluation** | Run an evaluator over a large dataset (thousands of traces) and view aggregated results. | Helps you spot systematic failures. |\n",
      "| **Evaluation dashboards** | Trend charts, heatmaps, and per‑prompt breakdowns. | Makes it easy to monitor drift over time. |\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.4 Deployment & Model Management\n",
      "\n",
      "| Feature | What it does | Why it matters |\n",
      "|---------|--------------|----------------|\n",
      "| **Deployment UI** | Define a “deployment” that points to a specific model, prompt version, and runtime configuration (e.g., temperature, max tokens). | Provides a stable endpoint for production services. |\n",
      "| **Versioned deployments** | Deployments are immutable; a new version creates a new endpoint, preserving the old one. | Guarantees backward compatibility and safe rollouts. |\n",
      "| **Canary & blue‑green releases** | Route a fraction of traffic to a new deployment and monitor metrics before full cut‑over. | Reduces risk of breaking changes. |\n",
      "| **Self‑hosted option** | Run the LangSmith server inside your VPC or on‑premises, with the same UI and API. | Meets strict data‑ residency or latency requirements. |\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.5 Agent Builder (Beta – No‑Code UI)\n",
      "\n",
      "* Drag‑and‑drop interface for building multi‑step LLM agents (e.g., tool‑using assistants, retrieval‑augmented generation pipelines).  \n",
      "* Generates runnable code that can be exported to your repo or deployed directly from the platform.  \n",
      "* Great for rapid prototyping, proof‑of‑concepts, or for product managers who want to experiment without writing code.\n",

      "### 2.6 API & SDK Integration\n",
      "\n",
      "| Integration | Details |\n",
      "|------------|---------|\n",
      "| **Python SDK** | `langsmith` package provides decorators (`@trace`, `@evaluate`) and helper functions to log traces automatically. |\n",
      "| **REST API** | Full CRUD on traces, evaluations, deployments, and tags – useful for custom dashboards or CI pipelines. |\n",
      "| **LangChain & LangGraph hooks** | Out‑of‑the‑box support; just enable `langsmith=True` when constructing a chain/graph. |\n",
      "| **VS Code & Claude extensions** | Inline “Ask LangSmith” commands that fetch trace details or evaluation results without leaving the editor. |\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2.7 Collaboration & Governance\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Workspaces & organizations** – Separate environments for dev, staging, and prod; role‑based access control (viewer, editor, admin).  \n",
      "* **Resource tagging** – Tag traces with cost centers, project IDs, or regulatory tags for auditability.  \n",
      "* **Export & import** – Export trace data to CSV/JSON or import external logs for unified analysis.  \n",
      "* **Audit logs** – Every change to a deployment, prompt, or evaluation is recorded for compliance.\n",

      "* **Scalability:** The architecture scales well to larger datasets and model sizes; later work (e.g., BERT, GPT, T5) builds directly on the Transformer core.\n",

The decoder attends both to its own previous outputs (masked self‑attention) and to the encoder’s final representations (encoder‑decoder attention). |\\n\\n#### Why it matters\\n\\n* **Speed & parallelism:** Because there are no recurrent connections, the whole sequence can be processed in parallel on GPUs/TPUs, dramatically reducing training time compared with LSTM/GRU‑based models.\\n* **State‑of‑the‑art performance:** On the WMT\\u202f2014 English‑German and English‑French translation benchmarks, the Transformer achieved **BLEU scores of 28.4 and 41.8**, respectively—substantially better than the previous best (which used deep LSTMs with attention).\\n* **Scalability:** The architecture scales well to larger datasets and model sizes; later work (e.g., BERT, GPT, T5) builds directly on the Transformer core.\\n* **General purpose:** Since its release, the Transformer has become the de‑facto backbone for virtually all modern NLP models and has also been adapted to vision (ViT), speech, reinforcement learning, and even protein folding (AlphaFold).\\n\\n#### Architecture snapshot\\n\\n```\\nInput → Embedding + Positional Encoding\\n      └─► Encoder (N identical layers)\\n          ├─► Multi‑head Self‑Attention\\n          └─► Feed‑Forward Network\\n      └─► Decoder (N identical layers)\\n          ├─► Masked Multi‑head Self‑Attention\\n          ├─► Multi‑head Encoder‑Decoder Attention\\n          └─► Feed‑Forward Network\\n      └─► Linear + Softmax → Output tokens\\n```\\n\\n#### Key equations (simplified)\\n\\n1. **Scaled dot‑product attention**  \\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\text{Attention}(Q,K,V)=\\\\text{softmax}\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{QK^{\\\\top}}{\\\\sqrt{d_k}}\\\\right)V\\n   \\\\]\\n2. **Multi‑head**  \\n   \\\\[\\n   \\\\text{MultiHead}(Q,K,V)=\\\\text{Concat}(\\\\text{head}_1,\\\\dots,\\\\text{head}_h)W^O\\n   \\\\]\\n   where each head \\\\( \\\\text{head}_i = \\\\text{Attention}(QW_i^Q, KW_i^K, VW_i^V) \\\\).\\n\\n3. **Positional encoding** (sinusoidal)  \\n   \\\\[\\n   PE_{(pos,2i)} = \\\\sin\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{\\\\text{model}}}}\\\\right),\\\\quad\\n   PE_{(pos,2i+1)} = \\\\cos\\\\!\\\\left(\\\\frac{pos}{10000^{2i/d_{\\\\text{model}}}}\\\\right)\\n   \\\\]\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Bottom line\\n\\n*“Attention Is All You Need”* proposes a **pure‑attention architecture** that replaces the traditional recurrent or convolutional components of sequence models. Its simplicity, efficiency, and strong empirical results sparked a wave of research that now dominates natural‑language processing, computer vision, and many other AI fields.'}"
